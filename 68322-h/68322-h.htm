<p class="drop-capy">IT is a very easy thing for four boys to make
up their minds to get four canoes and to go
on a canoe cruise, but it is not always so easy to
carry out such a project&mdash;as Charley Smith, Tom
Schuyler, Harry Wilson, and Joe Sharpe discovered.</p>

<p>Canoes cost money; and though some canoes cost
more than others, it is impossible to buy a new
wooden canoe of an approved model for less than
seventy-five dollars. Four canoes, at seventy-five
dollars each, would cost altogether three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
dollars. As the entire amount of pocket-money in
the possession of the boys was only seven dollars
and thirteen cents, it was clear that they were not
precisely in a position to buy canoes.</p>

<p>There was Harry’s uncle, who had already furnished
his nephew and his young comrades first
with a row-boat, and then with a sail-boat. Even a
benevolent uncle deserves some mercy, and the boys
agreed that it would never do to ask Uncle John
to spend three hundred dollars in canoes for them.
“The most we can ask of him,” said Charley Smith,
“is to let us sell the <i>Ghost</i> and use the money to
help pay for canoes.”</p>

<p>Now, the <i>Ghost</i>, in which the boys had made a
cruise along the south shore of Long Island, was a
very nice sail-boat, but it was improbable that any
one would be found who would be willing to give
more than two hundred dollars for her. There
would still be a hundred dollars wanting, and the
prospect of finding that sum seemed very small.</p>

<p>“If we could only have stayed on that water-logged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
brig and brought her into port we should
have made lots of money,” said Tom. “The captain
of the schooner that towed us home went back with
a steamer and brought the brig in yesterday. Suppose
we go and look at her once more?”</p>

<p>While cruising in the <i>Ghost</i> the boys had found
an abandoned brig, which they had tried to sail into
New York harbor, but they had been compelled to
give up the task, and to hand her over to the captain
of a schooner which towed the partly disabled
<i>Ghost</i> into port. They all thought they would like
to see the brig again, so they went down to Burling
Slip, where she was lying, and went on board her.</p>

<p>The captain of the schooner met the boys on the
dock. He was in excellent spirits, for the brig was
loaded with valuable South American timber, and
he was sure of receiving as much as ten thousand
dollars from her owners. He knew very well that,
while the boys had no legal right to any of the
money, they had worked hard in trying to save the
brig, and had been the means of putting her in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
way. He happened to be an honest, generous man,
and he felt very rich; so he insisted on making each
of the boys a present.</p>

<p>The present was sealed up in an envelope, which
he gave to Charley Smith, telling him not to look
at its contents until after dinner&mdash;the boys having
mentioned that they were all to take dinner together
at Uncle John’s house. Charley put the envelope
rather carelessly in his pocket; but when it
was opened it was found to contain four new one-hundred-dollar
bills.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the boys were delighted.
They showed the money to Uncle John,
who told them that they had fairly earned it, and
need feel no hesitation about accepting it. They
had now money enough to buy canoes, and to pay
the expenses of a canoe cruise. Mr. Schuyler, Mr.
Sharpe, and Charley’s guardian were consulted, and
at Uncle John’s request gave their consent to the
canoeing scheme. The first great difficulty in the
way was thus entirely removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know much about canoes,” remarked Uncle
John, when the boys asked his advice as to what
kind of canoes they should get, “but I know the
commodore of a canoe club. You had better go
and see him, and follow his advice. I’ll give you
a letter of introduction to him.”</p>

<p>No time was lost in finding the commodore, and
Charley Smith explained to him that four young
canoeists would like to know what was the very
best kind of canoe for them to get.</p>

<p>The Commodore, who, in spite of his magnificent
title, wasn’t in the least alarming, laughed, and said,
“That is a question that I’ve made up my mind
never to try to answer. But I’ll give you the names
of four canoeists, each of whom uses a different variety
of canoe. You go and see them, listen to what
they say, believe it all, and then come back and see
me, and we’ll come to a decision.” He then wrote
four notes of introduction, gave them to the boys,
and sent them away.</p>

<p>The first canoeist to whom the boys were referred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
received them with great kindness, and told them
that it was fortunate they had come to him. “The
canoe that you want,” said he, “is the ‘Rice Lake’
canoe, and if you had gone to somebody else, and
he had persuaded you to buy ‘Rob Roy’ canoes or
‘Shadows,’ you would have made a great mistake.
The ‘Rice Lake’ canoe is nearly flat-bottomed, and
so stiff that there is no danger that you will capsize
her. She paddles easily, and sails faster than any
other canoe. She is roomy, and you can carry about
twice as much in her as you can carry in a ‘Rob
Roy.’ She has no keel, so that you can run rapids
easily in her, and she is built in a peculiar way that
makes it impossible for her to leak. Don’t think
for a moment of getting any other canoe, for if you
do you will never cease to regret it.”</p>

<p>He was such a pleasant, frank gentleman, and was
so evidently earnest in what he said, that the boys
at once decided to get ‘Rice Lake’ canoes. They
did not think it worth while to make any farther
inquiries; but, as they had three other notes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
introduction with them, Tom Schuyler said that it
would hardly do to throw them away. So they
went to see the next canoeist, though without the
least expectation that he would say anything that
would alter their decision.</p>

<p>Canoeist No. 2 was as polite and enthusiastic as
canoeist No. 1. “So you boys want to get canoes,
do you?” said he. “Well, there is only one canoe
for you to get, and that is the ‘Shadow.’ She paddles
easily, and sails faster than any other canoe.
She’s not a flat-bottomed skiff, like the ‘Rice Laker,’
that will spill you whenever a squall strikes her,
but she has good bearings, and you can’t capsize her
unless you try hard. Then, she is decked all over,
and you can sleep in her at night, and keep dry
even in a thunder-storm; her water-tight compartments
have hatches in them, so that you can stow
blankets and things in them that you want to keep
dry; and she has a keel, so that when you run rapids,
and she strikes on a rock, she will strike on her
keel instead of her planks. It isn’t worth while for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
you to look at any other canoe, for there is no canoe
except the ‘Shadow’ that is worth having.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think much of the ‘Rice Lake’ canoe,
then?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Why, she isn’t a civilized canoe at all,” replied
the canoeist. “She is nothing but a heavy, wooden
copy of the Indian birch. She hasn’t any deck, she
hasn’t any water-tight compartments, and she hasn’t
any keel. Whatever else you do, don’t get a ‘Rice
Laker.’”</p>

<p>The boys thanked the advocate of the “Shadow,”
and when they found themselves in the street again
they wondered which of the two canoeists could be
right, for each directly contradicted the other, and
each seemed to be perfectly sincere. They reconsidered
their decision to buy “Rice Lake” canoes, and
looked forward with interest to their meeting with
canoeist No. 3.</p>

<p>That gentleman was just as pleasant as the other
two, but he did not agree with a single thing that
they had said. “There are several different models<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
of canoes,” he remarked, “but that is simply because
there are ignorant people in the world. Mr. Macgregor,
the father of canoeing, always uses a ‘Rob
Roy’ canoe, and no man who has once been in a
good ‘Rob Roy’ will ever get into any other canoe.
The ‘Rob Roy’ paddles like a feather, and will outsail
any other canoe. She weighs twenty pounds
less than those great, lumbering canal-boats, the
‘Shadow’ and the ‘Rice Laker,’ and it don’t break
your back to paddle her or to carry her round a
dam. She is decked over, but her deck isn’t all cut
up with hatches. There’s plenty of room to sleep in
her, and her water-tight compartments are what they
pretend to be&mdash;not a couple of leaky boxes stuffed
full of blankets.”</p>

<p>“We have been advised,” began Charley, “to get
‘Shadows’ or ‘Rice’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it,” interrupted the canoeist. “It’s
lucky for you that you came to see me. It is a perfect
shame for people to try to induce you to waste
your money on worthless canoes. Mind you get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
‘Rob Roys,’ and nothing else. Other canoes don’t
deserve the name. They are schooners, or scows,
or canal-boats, but the ‘Rob Roy’ is a genuine
canoe.”</p>

<p>“Now for the last canoeist on the list!” exclaimed
Harry as the boys left the office of canoeist No. 3.
“I wonder what sort of a canoe he uses?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad there is only one more of them for us
to see,” said Joe. “The Commodore told us to believe
all they said, and I’m trying my best to do it,
but it’s the hardest job I ever tried.”</p>

<p>The fourth canoeist was, on the whole, the most
courteous and amiable of the four. He begged his
young friends to pay no attention to those who recommended
wooden canoes, no matter what model
they might be. “Canvas,” said he, “is the only thing
that a canoe should be built of. It is light and
strong, and if you knock a hole in it you can mend
it in five minutes. If you want to spend a great
deal of money and own a yacht that is too small to
sail in with comfort and too clumsy to be paddled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
buy a wooden canoe; but if you really want to
cruise, you will, of course, get canvas canoes.”</p>

<p>“We have been advised to get ‘Rice Lakers,’
‘Shadows,’ and ‘Rob Roys,’” said Tom, “and we did
not know until now that there was such a thing
as a canvas canoe.”</p>

<p>“It is very sad,” replied the canoeist, “that people
should take pleasure in giving such advice. They
must know better. However, the subject is a painful
one, and we won’t discuss it. Take my advice,
my dear boys, and get canvas canoes. All the really
good canoeists in the country would say the same
thing to you.”</p>

<p>“We must try,” said Joe, as the boys walked back
to the Commodore’s office, “to believe that the ‘Rice
Laker,’ the ‘Shadow,’ the ‘Rob Roy,’ and the canvas
canoe is the best one ever built. It seems to me
something like believing that four and one are just
the same. Perhaps you fellows can do it, but I’m
not strong enough to believe as much as that all at
one time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The Commodore smiled when the boys entered his
office for the second time and said, “Well, of course
you’ve found out what is the best canoe, and know
just what you want to buy?”</p>

<p>“We’ve seen four men,” replied Harry, “and each
one says that the canoe that he recommends is the
only good one, and that all the others are good for
nothing.”</p>

<p>“I might have sent you to four other men, and
they would have told you of four other canoes, each
of which is the best in existence. But perhaps you
have already heard enough to make up your minds.”</p>

<p>“We’re farther from making up our minds than
ever,” said Harry. “I do wish you would tell us
what kind of canoe is really the best.”</p>

<p>“The truth is,” said the Commodore, “that there
isn’t much to choose among the different models of
canoes, and you’ll find that every canoeist is honestly
certain that he has the best one. Now, I won’t undertake
to select canoes for you, though I will suggest
that a light ‘Rob Roy’ would probably be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
good choice for the smallest of you boys. Why don’t
you try all four of the canoes that have just been
recommended to you? Then, if you cruise together,
you can perhaps find out if any one of them is really
better than the others. I will give you the names
of three or four builders, all of whom build good,
strong boats.”</p>

<p>This advice pleased the boys, and they resolved
to accept it. That evening they all met at Harry’s
home and decided what canoes they would get.
Harry determined to get a “Shadow,” Tom a “Rice
Laker,” Charley a canvas canoe, and Joe a “Rob
Roy;” and the next morning orders for the four
canoes were mailed to the builders whom the Commodore
had recommended.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_II"><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">IT was some time before the canoes were ready,
and in the mean time the young canoeists met
with a new difficulty. The canoe-builders wrote to
them wishing to know how they would have the
canoes rigged. It had never occurred to the boys
that there was more than one rig used on canoes,
and of course they did not know how to answer the
builders’ question. So they went to the Commodore
and told him their difficulty.</p>

<p>“I might do,” said he, “just as I did when I told
you to go and ask four different canoeists which is
the best canoe; but I won’t put you to that trouble.
I rather like the Lord Ross lateen rig better than
any other, but, as you are going to try different
kinds of canoes, it would be a good idea for you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
to try different rigs. For example, have your ‘Rob
Roy’ rigged with lateen-sails; rig the ‘Shadow’ with
a balance-lug, the ‘Rice Laker’ with a ‘sharpie’
leg-of-mutton, and the canvas canoe with the standing
lug. Each one of these rigs has its advocates,
who will prove to you that it is better than any
other, and you can’t do better than try them all.
Only be sure to tell the builders that every canoe
must have two masts, and neither of the two sails
must be too big to be safely handled.”</p>

<p>“How does it happen that every canoeist is so
perfectly certain that he has the best canoe and the
best rig in existence?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“That is one of the great merits of canoeing,”
replied the Commodore. “It makes every man contented,
and develops in him decision of character.
I’ve known a canoeist to have a canoe so leaky that
he spent half his time bailing her out, and rigged in
such a way that she would neither sail nor do anything
in a breeze except capsize; and yet he was
never tired of boasting of the immense superiority<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of his canoe. There’s a great deal of suffering in
canoeing,” continued the Commodore, musingly, “but
its effects on the moral character are priceless. My
dear boys, you have no idea how happy and contented
you will be when you are wet through,
cramped and blistered, and have to go into camp
in a heavy rain, and without any supper except
dry crackers.”</p>

<p>While the boys were waiting for their canoes
they read all the books on canoeing that they could
find, and searched through a dozen volumes of the
London <cite>Field</cite>, which they found in Uncle John’s
library, for articles and letters on canoeing. They
thus learned a good deal, and when their canoes
arrived they were able to discuss their respective
merits with a good degree of intelligence.</p>

<p>The “Rob Roy” and the “Shadow” were built
with white cedar planks and Spanish cedar decks.
They shone with varnish, and their nickel-plated
metal-work was as bright as silver. They were decidedly
the prettiest of the four canoes, and it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
have been very difficult to decide which was the
prettier of the two. The “Rice Laker” was built
without timbers or a keel, and was formed of two
thicknesses of planking riveted together, the grain of
the inner planking crossing that of the outer planking
at right angles. She looked strong and serviceable,
and before Tom had been in possession of her
half an hour he was insisting that she was much
the handiest canoe of the squadron, simply because
she had no deck. The outside planks were of butternut;
but they were pierced with so many rivets
that they did not present so elegant an appearance
as did the planks of the “Shadow” and the “Rob
Roy.” The canvas canoe consisted of a wooden
skeleton-frame, covered and decked with painted canvas.
She was very much the same in model as the
“Shadow;” and though she seemed ugly in comparison
with her varnished sisters, Charley claimed that
he would get more comfort out of his canoe than
the other boys would out of theirs, for the reason
that scratches that would spoil the beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
varnished wood could not seriously injure the painted
canvas. Thus each boy was quite contented,
and asserted that he would not change canoes with
anybody. They were equally well contented with
the way in which their canoes were rigged, and they
no longer wondered at the confident way in which
the canoeists to whom the Commodore had introduced
them spoke of the merits of their respective
boats.</p>

<p>Of course the subject of names for the canoes had
been settled long before the canoes arrived. Joe
had named his “Rob Roy” the <i>Dawn</i>; Harry’s
canoe was the <i>Sunshine</i>; Tom’s the <i>Twilight</i>; and
Charley’s the <i>Midnight</i>. The last name did not
seem particularly appropriate to a canoe, but it was
in keeping with the other names, and, as the canoe
was painted black, it might have been supposed to
have some reference to her color.</p>

<p>The boys had intended to join the American Canoe
Association, but Uncle John suggested that they
would do well to make a cruise, and to become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
real canoeists, before asking for admission to the association.
They then decided to form a canoe club
of their own, which they did; and Harry was elected
the first Commodore of the Columbian Canoe
Club, the flag of which was a pointed burgee of
blue silk, with a white paddle worked upon it.
Each canoe carried its private signal in addition to
the club flag, and bore its name in gilt letters on a
blue ground on each bow.</p>

<p>Where to cruise was a question which was decided
and reconsidered half a dozen times. From
the books which they had read the boys had learned
that there is, if anything, more fun in cruising
on a narrow stream than in sailing on broad rivers;
that running rapids is a delightful sport, and that
streams should always be descended instead of ascended
in a canoe. They, therefore, wanted to discover
a narrow stream with safe and easy rapids,
and also to cruise on some lake or wide river where
they could test the canoes under sail and under
paddle in rough water. They learned more of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
geography of the Eastern States and of Canada, in
searching the map for a good cruising route, than
they had ever learned at school; and they finally
selected a route which seemed to combine all varieties
of canoeing.</p>

<p>The cruise was to begin at the southern end of
Lake Memphremagog, in Vermont. On this lake,
which is thirty miles long, the young canoeists expected
to spend several days, and to learn to handle
the canoes under sail. From the northern end of
the lake, which is in Canada, they intended to descend
its outlet, the Magog River, which is a narrow
stream, emptying into the St. Francis River at
Sherbrooke. From Sherbrooke the St. Francis was to
be descended to the St. Lawrence, down which the
canoes were to sail to Quebec. They wrote to the
postmaster at Sherbrooke asking him if the Magog
and the St. Francis were navigable by canoes, and
when he replied that there were only one or two
rapids in the Magog, which they could easily run,
they were <ins class="corr" id="tn-26" title="more then ever">more than ever</ins> satisfied with their route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>The previous cruises that the boys had made had
taught them what stores and provisions were absolutely
necessary and what could be spared. Each
canoe was provided with a water-proof bag to hold
a blanket and dry clothes, and with a pair of small
cushions stuffed with elastic felt, a material lighter
than cork, and incapable of retaining moisture.
These cushions were to be used as mattresses at
night, and the rubber blankets were to be placed
over the canoes and used as shelter tents. Although
the mattresses would have made excellent life-preservers,
Uncle John presented each canoeist with a
rubber life-belt, which could be buckled around the
waist in a few seconds in case of danger of a capsize.
Harry provided his canoe with a canvas canoe-tent,
made from drawings published in the London <cite>Field</cite>,
but the others decided not to go to the expense of
making similar tents until Harry’s should have been
thoroughly tested.</p>

<p>When all was ready the blankets and stores
were packed in the <i>Sunshine</i>, the cockpit of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
was provided with hatches, which could be locked
up, thus making the canoe serve the purpose of
a trunk. The four canoes were then sent by rail
to Newport, at the southern end of Lake Memphremagog,
and a week later the boys followed them,
carrying their paddles by hand, for the reason that,
if they had been sent with the canoes and had
been lost or stolen, it would have been impossible
to start on the cruise until new paddles had been
procured.</p>

<p>Newport was reached, after an all-night journey,
at about two o’clock in the morning. The canoeists
went straight to the freight-house to inspect the
canoes. They were all there, resting on the heads
of a long row of barrels, and were apparently all
right. The varnish of the <i>Dawn</i> and the <i>Sunshine</i>
was scratched in a few places, and the canvas canoe
had a very small hole punched through her deck, as
if she had been too intimate with a nail in the course
of her journey. The boys were, however, well satisfied
with the appearance of the boats, and so walked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
up to the hotel to get dinner and a supply of sandwiches,
bread, and eggs for their supper.</p>

<p>Dinner was all ready, for, under the name of
breakfast, it was waiting for the passengers of the
train, which made a stop of half an hour at Newport.
A band was playing on the deck of a steamer
which was just about to start down the lake, and
the boys displayed appetites, as they sat near the
open window looking out on the beautiful landscape,
which rather astonished the waiter.</p>

<p>A good, quiet place for launching the canoes was
found, which was both shady and out of sight of the
hotel. It was easy enough to carry the three empty
canoes down to the shore; but the <i>Sunshine</i>, with
her heavy cargo, proved too great a load, and about
half-way between the freight-house and the shore
she had to be laid on the ground and partly emptied.
Here Joe, who tried to carry the spars and
paddles of four canoes on his shoulder, found that
there is nothing more exasperating than a load of
sticks of different sizes. No matter how firmly he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
tried to hold them together, they would spread apart
at every imaginable angle. Before he had gone
three rods he looked like some new kind of porcupine
with gigantic quills sticking out all over him.
Then he began to drop things, and, stooping to pick
them up, managed to trip himself and fall with a
tremendous clatter. He picked himself up and made
sixteen journeys between the spot where he fell and
the shore of the lake, carrying only one spar at a
time, and grasping that with both hands. His companions
sat down on the grass and laughed to see
the deliberate way in which he made his successive
journeys, but Joe, with a perfectly serious face, said
that he was going to get the better of those spars,
no matter how much trouble it might cost him, and
that he was not going to allow them to get together
and play tricks on him again.</p>

<p class="center">“SHE’S HALF FULL OF WATER.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was tiresome stooping over, packing the canoes,
but finally they were all in order, and the Commodore
gave the order to launch them. The lake
was perfectly calm, and the little fleet started under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
paddle for a long, sandy point that jutted out into
the lake some three miles from Newport. The <i>Sunshine</i>
and the <i>Dawn</i> paddled side by side, and the
two other canoes followed close behind them.</p>

<p>“Boys, isn’t this perfectly elegant?” exclaimed Harry,
laying down his paddle when the fleet was about
a mile from the shore and bathing his hot head
with water from the lake. “Did you ever see anything
so lovely as this blue water?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Charley; “the water’s all right outside
of the canoes, but I’d rather have a little less
inside of mine.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean,” asked Harry. “Is she
leaking?”</p>

<p>“She’s half full of water, that’s all,” replied Charley,
beginning to bail vigorously with his hat.</p>

<p>“Halloo!” cried Joe, suddenly. “Here’s the water
up to the top of my cushions.”</p>

<p>“We’d better paddle on and get ashore as soon as
possible,” said Harry. “My boat is leaking a little
too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Charley bailed steadily for ten minutes, and somewhat
reduced the amount of water in his canoe.
The moment he began paddling, however, the leak
increased. He paddled with his utmost strength,
knowing that if he did not soon reach land he would
be swamped; but the water-logged canoe was very
heavy, and he could not drive her rapidly through
the water. His companions kept near him, and advised
him to drop his paddle and to bail, but he
knew that the water was coming in faster than he
could bail it out, and so he wasted no time in the
effort. It soon became evident that his canoe would
never keep afloat to reach the sand-spit for which
he had been steering, so he turned aside and paddled
for a little clump of rushes, where he knew
the water must be shallow. Suddenly he stopped
paddling, and almost at the same moment his canoe
sunk under him, and he sprung up to swim clear
of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_III"><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">LUCKILY the water was only four feet deep, as
Charley found when he tried to touch bottom;
so he stopped swimming, and, with the water nearly
up to his shoulders, stood still and began to think
what to do next.</p>

<p>The canoes&mdash;including the sunken <i>Midnight</i>&mdash;were
a good mile from the shore, and although the sandy
shoal on which Charley was standing was firm and
hard it was of small extent, and the water all around
it was too deep to be waded.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get into one of our canoes,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“How am I going to do it without capsizing her?”
replied Charley.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it can be done,” said Harry, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
looked first at the <i>Sunshine</i> and then at the <i>Twilight</i>;
“but then you’ve got to do it somehow. You
can’t swim a whole mile, can you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can’t, but then it wouldn’t do me any
good to spill one of you fellows by trying to climb
out of the water into a canoe that’s as full now as
she ought to be. Besides, I’m not going to desert
the <i>Midnight</i>.”</p>

<p>“I thought the <i>Midnight</i> had deserted you,” said
Joe. “If my canoe should go to the bottom of the
lake without giving me any warning, I shouldn’t
think it a bit rude to leave her there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense!” exclaimed Charley; “but
come here and help me get my canoe afloat again.
We can do it, I think, if we go to work the right
way.”</p>

<p>Charley found no difficulty in getting hold of the
painter of his canoe with the help of his paddle.
Giving the end of the painter to Joe, he took the
<i>Dawn’s</i> painter, and by ducking down under the
water succeeded after two or three attempts in reeving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
it through the stern-post of the sunken canoe,
and giving one end to Harry and the other to Tom.
Then, taking the bow painter from Joe, he grasped it
firmly with both hands, and at a given signal all the
boys, except Joe, made a desperate effort to bring
the wreck to the surface.</p>

<p>They could not do it. They managed to raise her
off the bottom, but Harry and Tom in their canoes
could not lift to any advantage, and so were forced
to let her settle down again.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to unload her,” said Charley, gloomily.
“I think we can get her up if there is nothing in her
except water. Anyhow we’ve got to try.”</p>

<p>It was tiresome work to get the water-soaked
stores and canned provisions out of the canoe, and
Charley had to duck his head under the water at
least a dozen times before the heaviest part of the
<i>Midnight’s</i> cargo could be brought up and passed
into the other canoes. His comrades wanted to jump
overboard and help him, but he convinced them that
they would have great difficulty in climbing back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
into their canoes, and that in all probability they
would capsize themselves in so doing. “He’s right!”
cried Joe. “Commodore, please make an order that
hereafter only one canoe shall be wrecked at a time.
We must keep some dry stores in the fleet.”</p>

<p>When the <i>Midnight</i> was partly unloaded a new
and successful effort was made to raise her. As
soon as she reached the surface Charley rolled her
over, bottom upward, and in this position the small
amount of air imprisoned under her kept her afloat.</p>

<p>The cause of the leak was quickly discovered.
There was a hole through her canvas bottom nearly
an inch in diameter, made by some blow she had received
while on the way to the lake. The wonder
was, not that she sunk when she did, but that she
had floated long enough to be paddled a mile. It is
probable that the ballast-bag, which was close by the
hole, had partly stopped the leak at first, but had
afterward been slightly moved, thus permitting the
water to rush freely in.</p>

<p>The surface of painted canvas dries very quickly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
in the hot sun, and it was not long before the bottom
of the <i>Midnight</i> was dry enough to be temporarily
patched. Harry lighted his spirit-lamp and
melted a little of the lump of rosin and tallow which
had been provided for mending leaks. This was
spread over a patch of new canvas: the patch was
then placed over the hole, and more of the melted
rosin and tallow smeared over it. In about fifteen
minutes the patch was dry enough to be serviceable,
and Charley righted the canoe, hailed her out, and
by throwing himself across the cockpit, and then
carefully turning himself so as to get his legs into it,
found himself once more afloat and ready to paddle.</p>

<p>The canoe still leaked, but the leak could be kept
under without difficulty by occasional bailing, and
in the course of half an hour the sand-spit for which
the fleet had started was reached. It was part of a
large island with steep, rocky shores and a beautiful
little sandy beach. It was just the place for a camp;
and though the boys had expected to camp some
miles farther north, the sinking of Charley’s canoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
had so delayed them that it was already nearly six
o’clock, and they therefore decided to paddle no farther
that day.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">A STAMPEDE IN CAMP.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The canoes were hauled out on the beach, and unloaded
and shored up with their rudders, backboards,
and a few pieces of drift-wood so as to stand
on an even keel. Then came the work of rigging
shelters over them for the night. Harry’s canoe-tent
was supported by four small upright sticks resting
on the deck and fitting into cross-pieces sewed
into the roof of the tent. The sides and ends buttoned
down to the gunwale and deck of the canoe,
and two curtains, one on each side, which could be
rolled up like carriage-curtains in fair weather and
buttoned down in rainy weather, served both as the
doors and windows of the tent. The shelters rigged
by the other boys were much less complete. The
two masts of each canoe were stepped, the paddle
was lashed between them, and a rubber blanket was
hung over the paddle, with its edges reaching nearly
to the ground. The blankets and the bags which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
served as pillows were then arranged, and the canoes
were ready for the night.</p>

<p>It was a warm and clear night, and a breeze which
came up from the south at sunset blew the mosquitoes
away. Harry found his tent, with the curtains
rolled up, cool and pleasant; but his fellow-canoeists
found themselves fairly suffocating under their rubber
blankets, and were compelled to throw them aside.</p>

<p>Toward morning, when the day was just beginning
to dawn, the canoeists were suddenly awakened
by a rush of many heavy, trampling feet which
shook the ground. It was enough to startle any
one, and the boys sprung up in such a hurry that
Harry struck his head against the roof of his tent,
knocked it down, upset the canoe, and could not at
first decide whether he was taking part in a railway
collision or whether an earthquake of the very
best quality had happened. The cause of the disturbance
was a herd of horses trotting down to the
water’s edge to drink. There were at least twenty
of them, and had the canoes happened to be in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
path they might have stumbled over them in the
faint morning light; in which case the boys would
have had the experience of being shipwrecked on
dry land.</p>

<p>A gentle southerly breeze wrinkled the water
while breakfast was cooking, and the Commodore
ordered that the masts and sails should be got
ready for use. It was impossible to make an early
start, for Charley’s blankets had to be dried in the
sun, and the hole in his canoe had to be repaired
with a new patch in a thorough and workmanlike
way. It was, therefore, ten o’clock before the canoes
were ready to be launched; and in the mean
time the wind had increased so much that the boys
decided to use only their main-sails.</p>

<p>The moment the sails drew the canoes shot off
at a pace which filled the young canoeists with delight.
The canoes were in good trim for sailing,
as they were not overloaded; and while they were
skirting the west shore of the island the water was
quite smooth. Each canoe carried a bag partly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
filled with sand for ballast, and every one except
Joe had lashed his ballast-bag to the keelson. This
was a precaution which Joe had forgotten to take,
and before long he had good reason to regret his
error.</p>

<p>As soon as the northern end of the island was
passed the canoes came to a part of the lake where
there was quite a heavy sea. The <i>Dawn</i> and the
<i>Twilight</i> were steered by the paddle, which passed
through a row-lock provided for the purpose; and
Joe and Tom found little difficulty in keeping their
canoes directly before the wind. The two other
canoes were steered with rudders, and occasionally,
when their bows dipped, their rudders were thrown
nearly out of the water, in consequence of which
they steered wildly. All the canoes showed a tendency
to roll a good deal, and now and then a little
water would wash over the deck. It was fine
sport running down the lake with such a breeze,
and the boys enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>The wind continued to rise, and the lake became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
covered with white-caps. “Commodore,” said Charley
Smith, “I don’t mean to show any disrespect to
my commanding officer, but it seems to me this is
getting a little risky.”</p>

<p>“How is it risky?” asked Harry. “You’re a sailor
and know twice as much about boats as I do,
if I am Commodore.”</p>

<p>“It’s risky in two or three ways. For instance,
if the wind blows like this much longer a following
sea will swamp some one of us.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we’re going fast enough to keep out of the
way of the sea,” cried Joe.</p>

<p>“Just notice how your canoe comes almost to a
dead stop every time she sinks between two seas,
and you won’t feel quite so sure that you’re running
faster than the sea is.”</p>

<p>The boys saw that Charley was right. The canoes
were so light that they lost their headway between
the seas, and it was evident that they were
in danger of being overtaken by a following sea.</p>

<p>“Tell us two or three more dangers, just to cheer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
us up, won’t you?” asked Joe, who was in high spirits
with the excitement of the sail.</p>

<p>“There’s the danger of rolling our booms under,
and there is a great deal of danger that Harry’s
canoe and mine will broach-to when our rudders
are out of water.”</p>

<p>“What will happen if they do broach-to?”</p>

<p>“They’ll capsize, that’s all,” replied Charley.</p>

<p>“What had we better do?” asked Harry. “There’s
no use in capsizing ourselves in the middle of the
lake.”</p>

<p>“My advice is that we haul on the port tack,
and run over to the west shore. The moment we
get this wind and sea on the quarter we shall be
all right&mdash;though, to be sure, we’ve got more sail
up than we ought to have.”</p>

<p>The canoes were quite near together, with the
exception of the <i>Twilight</i>, which was outsailing the
others; but even she was still near enough to be
hailed. Harry hailed her, and ordered the fleet to
steer for a cove on the west shore. As soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
wind was brought on the port quarter the canoes
increased their speed; and although the <i>Twilight</i>
made more leeway than the others, she drew ahead
of them very fast. The wind was now precisely
what the canoes wanted to bring out their sailing
qualities. The <i>Sunshine</i> soon showed that she was
the most weatherly, as the <i>Twilight</i> was the least
weatherly, of the fleet. The <i>Midnight</i> kept up very
fairly with the <i>Sunshine</i>; and the <i>Dawn</i>, with her
small lateen-sail, skimmed over the water so fast
that it was evident that if she could have carried
the big balance-lug of the <i>Sunshine</i> she would easily
have beaten her.</p>

<p>The canoes were no longer in danger of being
swamped; but the wind continuing to rise, the boys
found that they were carrying more sail than was
safe. They did not want to take in their sails and
paddle, and though all of the sails except the <i>Dawn’s</i>
lateen could be reefed, nobody wanted to be the
first to propose to reef; and Harry, in his excitement,
forgot all about reefing. The wind, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
had been blowing very steadily, now began to blow
in gusts, and the boys had to lean far out to windward
to keep their canoes right side up.</p>

<p>“We can’t keep on this way much longer without
coming to grief,” Charley cried at the top of
his lungs, so that Harry, who was some distance to
windward, could hear him.</p>

<p>“What do you say?” replied Harry.</p>

<p>“We’ve got too much sail on,” yelled Charley.</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll sail on. This is perfectly gorgeous!”
was Harry’s answer.</p>

<p>“He don’t hear,” said Charley. “I say, Joe, you’d
better take in your main-sail, and set the dandy in
its place. You’ll spill yourself presently.”</p>

<p>“The dandy’s stowed down below, where I can’t
get at it. I guess I can hold her up till we get
across.”</p>

<p>Tom was by this time far out of hailing distance,
and was apparently getting on very well. Charley
did not doubt that he could manage his own canoe
well enough, but he was very uneasy about Harry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
and Joe, who did not seem to realize that they were
carrying sail altogether too recklessly. The fleet was
nearly two miles from the shore, and a capsize in the
heavy sea that was running would have been no
joke.</p>

<p>Charley turned part way around in his canoe to
see if his life-belt was in handy reach. As he did so
he saw that the water a quarter of a mile to windward
was black with a fierce squall that was approaching.
He instantly brought his canoe up to
the wind, so that the squall would strike him on the
port bow, and called out to Harry and Joe to follow
his example. Harry did not hear him, and Joe, instead
of promptly following Charley’s advice, stopped
to wonder what he was trying to do. The squall
explained the matter almost immediately. It struck
the <i>Sunshine</i> and the <i>Dawn</i>, and instantly capsized
them, and then rushed on to overtake Tom, and to
convince him that Lake Memphremagog is not a
good place for inexperienced canoeists who want to
carry sail recklessly in squally weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_IV"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">FROM the books they had read Harry and Joe
had learned exactly what to do in case of capsizing
under sail, and had often discussed the matter.
“When I capsize,” Harry would say, “I shall pull
the masts out of her, and she’ll then right of her own
accord. Then I shall unship the rudder, put my
hands on the stern-post, and raise myself up so that
I can straddle the deck, and gradually work my way
along until I can get into the cockpit. After that I
shall bail her out, step the masts, and sail on again.”
Nothing could be easier than to describe this plan
while sitting in a comfortable room on shore, but to
carry it out in a rough sea was a different affair.</p>

<p>Harry was not at all frightened when he found
himself in the water, and he instantly swum clear of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the canoe, to avoid becoming entangled in her rigging.
He then proceeded to unship the masts and
the rudder, and when this was done tried to climb
in over the stern. He found that it was quite impossible.
No sooner would he get astride of the stern
than the canoe would roll and throw him into the
water again. After half a dozen attempts he gave it
up, and swimming to the side of the canoe managed
to throw himself across the cockpit. This was the
way in which Charley Smith had climbed into his
canoe the day before, and to Harry’s great surprise&mdash;for
no such method of climbing into a canoe had
been mentioned in any of the books he had read&mdash;it
proved successful.</p>

<p>Of course the deck of the canoe was now level
with the water, which washed in and out of her
with every sea that struck her. Harry seized the
empty tin can which he used as a bailer, and which
was made fast to one of the timbers of the canoe
with a line, to prevent it from floating away, but
he could not make any headway in bailing her out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
The water washed into her just as fast as he could
throw it out again, and he began to think that he
should have to paddle the canoe ashore full of water.
This would have been hard work, for with so much
water in her she was tremendously heavy and unwieldy;
but, after getting her head up to the wind
with his paddle, he found that less water washed
into her, and after long and steady work he succeeded
in bailing most of it out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charley, whose help Harry had declined,
because he felt so sure that he could get out
of his difficulty by following the plan that he had
learned from books on canoeing, was trying to help
Joe. At first Joe thought it was a good joke to be
capsized. His Lord Ross lateen-sail, with its boom
and yard, had floated clear of the canoe of its own
accord, and, as the only spar left standing was a mast
about two feet high, she ought to have righted. But
Joe had forgotten to lash his sand-bag to the keelson,
and the result was that whenever he touched
the canoe she would roll completely over and come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
up on the other side. Joe could neither climb in
over the stern nor throw himself across the deck,
and every attempt he made resulted in securing
for him a fresh ducking. Charley tried to help
him by holding on to the capsized canoe, but he
could not keep it right side up; and as Joe soon began
to show signs of becoming exhausted Charley
was about to insist that he should hang on to the
stern of the <i>Midnight</i>, and allow himself to be towed
ashore, when Tom in the <i>Twilight</i> arrived on the
scene.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">NOT SO EASY AS IT LOOKS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tom had seen the <i>Dawn</i> and the <i>Sunshine</i> capsize,
and was far enough to leeward to have time to take
in his sail before the squall reached him. It therefore
did him no harm, and he paddled up against the
wind to help his friends. It took him some time to
reach the <i>Dawn</i>, for it blew so hard that when one
blade of the paddle was in the water he could hardly
force the other blade against the wind. Before the
cruise was over he learned that by turning one blade
at right angles to the other&mdash;for the two blades of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
paddle are joined together by a ferrule in the middle&mdash;he
could paddle against a head-wind with much
less labor.</p>

<p>The <i>Twilight</i>, being an undecked “Rice Lake” canoe,
could easily carry two persons, and, with the
help of Charley and Tom, Joe climbed into her.
Charley then picked up the floating sail of the
<i>Dawn</i>, made her painter fast to his own stern, and
started under paddle for the shore. It was not a
light task to tow the water-logged canoe, but both
the sea and the wind helped him, and he landed by
the time that the other boys had got the camp-fire
started and the coffee nearly ready.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry, “I’ve learned how to get into
a canoe to-day. If I’d stuck to the rule and tried to
get in over the stern I should be out in the lake yet.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to write to the London <cite>Field</cite> and get
it to print my new rule about capsizing,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Charley. “To turn somersaults
in the water? That was what you were doing
all the time until Tom came up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“That was for exercise, and had nothing to do
with my rule, which is, ‘Always have a fellow in a
“Rice Lake” canoe to pick you up.’”</p>

<p>“All your trouble came from forgetting to lash
your ballast-bag,” remarked Harry. “I hope it will
teach you a lesson.”</p>

<p>“That’s a proper remark for a Commodore who
wants to enforce discipline,” cried Charley; “but I
insist that the trouble came from carrying too much
sail.”</p>

<p>“The sail would have been all right if it hadn’t
been for the wind,” replied Harry.</p>

<p>“And the wind wouldn’t have done us any harm
if we hadn’t been on the lake,” added Joe.</p>

<p>“Boys, attention!” cried Harry. “Captain Charles
Smith is hereby appointed sailing-master of this fleet,
and will be obeyed and respected accordingly, or, at
any rate, as much as he can make us obey and respect
him. Anyhow, it will be his duty to tell us
how much sail to carry, and how to manage the canoes
under sail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“This is the second day of the cruise,” remarked
Joe an hour later, as he crept into his blankets, “and
I have been wet but once. There is something
wrong about it, for on our other cruises I was always
wet through once every day. However, I’ll
hope for the best.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the night Joe had reason to feel
more satisfied. It began to rain. As his rubber
blanket was wet, and in that state seemed hotter
than ever, Joe could not sleep under the shelter of
it, and, as on the previous night, went to sleep with
nothing over him but his woollen blanket. His head
was underneath the deck, and as the rain began to
fall very gently, it did not awaken him until his
blanket was thoroughly wet.</p>

<p>He roused himself and sat up. He was startled
to see a figure wrapped in a rubber blanket sitting
on his deck. “Who’s there?” he asked, suddenly.
“Sing out, or I’ll shoot!”</p>

<p>“You can’t shoot with a jack-knife or a tin bailer,
so I’m not much afraid of you,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Tom, is it?” said Joe, much relieved.
“What in the world are you doing there?”</p>

<p>“My canoe’s half full of water, so I came out into
the rain to get dry.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you keep the rain out of the canoe
with the rubber blanket?”</p>

<p>“The canoe is fourteen feet long, and hasn’t any
deck, and the blanket is six feet long. I had the
blanket hung over the paddle, but of course the
rain came in at the ends of the canoe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m pretty wet, for I didn’t cover my canoe
at all. What’ll we do?”</p>

<p>“Sit here till it lets up, I suppose,” replied Tom.
“It must stop raining some time.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a better plan than that. Is your rubber
blanket dry inside? Mine isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s dry enough.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put it on the ground to lie on, and use my
rubber blanket for a tent. We can put it over a
ridge-pole about two feet from the ground, and
stake the edges down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>“What will we do for blankets? It’s too cold to
sleep without them.”</p>

<p>“We can each borrow one from Harry and Charley.
They’ve got two apiece, and can spare one of
them.”</p>

<p>Joe’s plan was evidently the only one to be
adopted; and so the two boys pitched their little
rubber tent, borrowed two blankets, and crept under
shelter. They were decidedly wet, but they
lay close together and managed to keep warm.
In the morning they woke up rested and comfortable,
to find a bright sun shining and their clothes
dried by the heat of their bodies. Neither had
taken the slightest cold, although they had run what
was undoubtedly a serious risk, in spite of the fact
that one does not easily take cold when camping
out.</p>

<p>As they were enjoying their breakfast the canoeists
naturally talked over the events of the previous
day and night. Harry had been kept perfectly
dry by his canoe-tent&mdash;one side of which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
had left open, so as to have plenty of fresh air; and
Charley had also been well protected from the rain
by his rubber blanket, hung in the usual way over
the paddle, although he had been far too warm to
be comfortable.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of suffocating under that rubber blanket
of mine, and I’ve invented a new way of covering
the canoe at night, which will leave me a little
air to breathe. I’ll explain it to you when we camp
to-night, Joe.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it, for I’ve made up my mind
that I’d rather be rained on than take a Turkish
bath all night long under that suffocating blanket.”</p>

<p>“Will your new plan work on my canoe?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“No; nothing will keep that ‘Rice Lake’ bathtub
of yours dry in a rain, unless you deck her
over.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m going to do when we get to
Magog. I’ll buy some canvas and deck over the
ends of my canoe. Sleeping in her in the rain as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
she is now is like sleeping in a cistern with the
water running into it.”</p>

<p>“Now that we’ve had a chance to try our sails,
which rig do you like best, Sailing-master?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“That lateen-rig that Joe has,” replied Charley.
“He can set his sail and take it in while the rest
of us are trying to find our halyards. Did you see
how the whole concern&mdash;spars and sail&mdash;floated free
of the canoe of their own accord the moment she
capsized?”</p>

<p>“That’s so; but then my big balance-lug holds
more wind than Joe’s sail.”</p>

<p>“It held too much yesterday. It’s a first-rate rig
for racing, but it isn’t anything like as handy as
the lateen for cruising; neither is my standing-lug.
I tried to get it down in a hurry yesterday, and
the halyards jammed, and I couldn’t get it down
for two or three minutes.”</p>

<p>“I can get my leg-of mutton in easy enough,”
remarked Tom, “but I can’t get the mast out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the step unless the water’s perfectly smooth, and I
don’t believe I could then without going ashore.”</p>

<p>“Now, Commodore,” said Charley, “if you’ll give
the order to start, I’ll give the order to carry all
sail. The breeze is light and the water is smooth,
and we ought to run down to the end of the lake
by noon.”</p>

<p>The little fleet made a beautiful appearance as it
cruised down the lake under full sail. The breeze
was westerly, which fact enabled the canoes to
carry their after-sails&mdash;technically known as “dandies”&mdash;to
much advantage. When running directly
before the wind the “dandy” is sometimes a dangerous
sail, as it is apt to make the canoe broach-to;
but with a wind from any other direction than
dead aft it is a very useful sail.</p>

<p>The canoes sailed faster than they had sailed the
day before, because there was no rough sea to check
their headway. They reached Magog at noon, went
to the hotel for a good dinner, bought some canvas
with which to deck Tom’s canoe, and then looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
at the dam which crosses the Magog River a few
rods from the lake, and wondered how they were
ever to get through the rapids below it.</p>

<p>There was a place where the canoes could be
lowered one by one over the breast of the dam and
launched in a little eddy immediately below. The
rapids, which extended from below the dam for nearly
a quarter of a mile, were, however, very uninviting
to a timid canoeist. The water did not seem
to be more than three or four feet deep, but it was
very swift, and full of rocks. “You boys can’t never
run them rapids in them boats,” said a man who
came to look at the canoes. “You’ll have to get a
cart and haul round ’em.”</p>

<p>The boys did not like to be daunted by their
first rapid, and, as there did not seem to be much
risk of drowning, they decided to take the chances
of getting the canoes through it safely. Harry gave
the order to lash everything fast in the canoes that
could be washed overboard, and he prepared to lead
the way in the <i>Sunshine</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>It was magnificent sport shooting down the rapid
like an arrow. The canoes drove through two
or three waves which washed the decks, though
the canoe-aprons of the <i>Dawn</i>, <i>Sunshine</i>, and <i>Midnight</i>
kept the water from getting into the cockpits.
Harry’s and Charley’s canoes each struck once on
the same rock while in the rapid, but in each case
only the keel struck the rock, and the current dragged
the canoes safely over it. When the fleet was
reunited in the smooth water below the rapid the
boys expressed their enthusiasm by all talking at
once at the top of their lungs. Every one was
delighted with the way his canoe had acted, and
with the skill with which he had avoided this or
that rock, or had discovered the best channel just
at the right moment. In their excitement they let
the canoes float gently down the stream, until they
suddenly discovered another rapid at the beginning
of a sharp bend in the river just ahead of them.</p>

<p>It was nothing like as fierce in appearance as the
first rapid, and as Harry led the way the others followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
close after him, one behind the other, fancying
that they could run the rapid without the least trouble.
Half-way down Harry’s canoe struck on a rock,
swung broadside to the current, and hung there.
Tom was so close behind him that he could not alter
his course, and so ran straight into the <i>Sunshine</i>
with a terrible crash. The <i>Dawn</i> and the <i>Twilight</i>
instantly followed, and as the four canoes thus piled
together keeled over and spilled their occupants
into the river, it began to look as if the rapid had
determined to make the irreverent young canoeists
respect it.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_V"><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">WHEN the boys were compelled to jump overboard
they could see that the water was only
about two feet deep; but they did not know whether
they could stand up against the fierce current. They
found that they could, although they had to move
slowly to avoid being swept off their feet. Harry’s
canoe was easily pushed off the rock on which it had
run, and the moment it was out of the way the other
canoes were free. Each canoeist seized the stern of
his own canoe, and let it drag him down the rest
of the rapid, which fortunately was a short one.
While performing this feat the knees of the canoeists
were scraped over the rocks, and they received
several unpleasant bruises; but they thought it was
impossible to get into their canoes in swift water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and so had no choice except to float down hanging
on to the sterns of the canoes.</p>

<p>Reaching the smooth water, they swum and pushed
the canoes before them toward the shore. Here they
found a great bank of sawdust that had floated down
the river from the mill at Magog, and it was so soft
and elastic that they determined to sleep on it that
night, instead of sleeping in their canoes, since the
sky was perfectly clear and there was no danger of
rain.</p>

<p>The canoes were hauled out on the bank, so that
the stores could be readily taken out of them. The
canvas canoe did not seem to be in the least injured
either by the rock on which she had struck or by
the collision with the other canoes. Harry’s canoe
had sustained a little damage where one of the
planks had been ground against the rock on which
she had hung so long, but it was not enough to
cause her to leak, and the injuries of the other canoes
were confined to their varnish.</p>

<p>“All the trouble,” remarked Harry, “came from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
following too close after one another. To-morrow,
if we find any more rapids, we will keep the canoes
far enough apart, so that if one canoe runs aground
the others can turn out for her.”</p>

<p>“We could have got into the canoes easy enough
if we had only thought so,” said Tom. “If I’d stood
up on the rock and held the canoe along-side of it, I
could have stepped in without any difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you do it, then?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t happen to think of it, and because
all the rest of you had started to float down
after your canoes.”</p>

<p>“I noticed one thing about a rapid which if I was
Commodore it would be my duty to impress on your
faithful but ignorant minds,” said Joe. “When you
see a big ripple on the water the rock that makes it
isn’t under the ripple, but is about four or five feet
higher up stream.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed Harry. “I ought to have
remembered that, for Macgregor speaks about it in
one of his books.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“Whereabouts did your canoe strike, Commodore?”
inquired Charley.</p>

<p>“Oh, about midships.”</p>

<p>“And of course she swung round broadside to the
current.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she, though! If I’d jumped out of her on
the side I intended to when she first struck she
would have swung against my legs; but I remembered
that you must always jump out of a canoe in
a rapid on the side above her.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the side above her?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I mean that you must not jump out below her.”</p>

<p>“That’s as clear as anything could be,” said Joe.
“Still, I’d like to know what you mean by ‘below
her.’”</p>

<p>“There’s an upper end and a lower end to every
rapid, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, the side of the canoe toward the upper end
of a rapid is what I call ‘above her.’ If you jump<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
out on that side she can’t float against your legs and
smash them.”</p>

<p>“Now, if you’ve got through with that question,”
continued Charley, “I want to say that if the Commodore
had put his stores and his ballast-bag in the
stern of his canoe, so as to make her draw a good
deal more water aft than she did forward, she
would have struck aft of midships, and wouldn’t
have swung around.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. That’s just what Macgregor recommends,
but I forgot it. Boys, I hereby order
every canoe to be loaded with all her ballast and
cargo in the after compartment before we start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And I want to remind you fellows of one more
thing,” said Charley. “When the current is sweeping
you toward a concave shore&mdash;that is, where the
river makes a bend&mdash;don’t try to keep your canoe
clear of the shore by hard paddling. Just backwater
on the side of the canoe that is toward the
middle of the river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“That’s Macgregor again!” cried Harry; “but I’d
forgotten it. To-morrow we’ll run our rapids in real
scientific style.”</p>

<p>“Provided there are any more rapids,” suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>“What did that Sherbrooke postmaster say about
the Magog rapids?” inquired Joe.</p>

<p>“Said there weren’t any, except one or two which
we could easily run,” replied Harry.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve probably got through with the rapids,”
said Charley. “I’m rather sorry, for it’s good
fun running them.”</p>

<p>Supper was now over, and the canoeists, spreading
their rubber blankets on the sawdust, prepared
to “turn in.” They were in a wild and beautiful
spot. The great “Rock Forest,” as it is called,
through which the Magog runs, is of vast extent,
and is inhabited by bears and smaller wild animals.
The boys from their camping-ground could see nothing
but the river, the dense woods on either bank,
and the bright moonlit sky above them. The rapid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
was roaring as if it was angry at having failed to
wreck the canoes, and the only other sound was the
crackling of branches in the forest, and the occasional
sighing of the gentle breeze. The boys were tired,
and, lulled by the sound of the rapids, soon dropped
asleep.</p>

<p>The recent rains had dampened the sawdust to
the depth of about two inches, but below this depth
it was dry and inflammable. A small fire had been
made with which to cook supper, and the dampness
of the sawdust had made the boys so confident that
the fire would not spread, that they had not taken
the trouble to put it out before going to sleep.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the damp sawdust on which
the fire had been kindled gradually became dry, and
finally took fire. It burnt very slowly on the surface,
but the dry sawdust immediately below burnt
like tinder. About two hours after Harry had closed
his eyes he was awakened from a dream that he had
upset a burning spirit-lamp over his legs. To his
horror he saw that the whole bank of sawdust was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
on fire. Smoke was everywhere creeping up through
the damp top layer, and at a little distance from the
canoes the smouldering fire had burst into roaring
flames.</p>

<p>Harry instantly called his comrades, and starting
up they rushed to the canoes, threw their blankets
and stores into them, and prepared to launch them.
They had not a moment to spare. The flames were
close to them, and were spreading every moment,
and as they shoved the canoes toward the water
their feet repeatedly sunk down through the ashes
below the surface, the flames springing up as they
hurriedly drew their feet back. It did not take
many minutes to get the canoes into the water and
to embark, but as the canoeists pushed out into the
river the part of the bank where they had been sleeping
burst into flames.</p>

<p>A light breeze had sprung up which was just
enough to fan the fire and to carry it into an immense
pile of dry drift-wood that lay on the shore
below the sawdust bank. The boys waited in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
quiet eddy near the bank and watched the progress
of the fire. It licked up the drift-wood in a very few
moments, and then, roaring with exultation over the
work it had done, it swept into the forest. In half
an hour’s time a forest fire was burning which threatened
to make a terrible destruction of timber, and
the heat had grown so intense that the canoeists
were compelled to drop down the stream to avoid it.</p>

<p>Canoeing at night is always a ticklish business,
but on a swift river, full of rapids, as is the Magog,
it is exceedingly dangerous. The fire lighted the
way for the fleet for a short distance, but before a
landing-place was reached a turn on the river shut
out the light, and at the same time the noise of a
rapid close at hand was heard.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">“HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE ROOT OF A TREE AND KEPT HIS CANOE
STATIONARY.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The boys had no desire to entangle themselves in
unknown rapids in the dark, and paddled at once
for the shore opposite to that where the fire was
raging. They found when they reached it that it
was a perpendicular bank on which it was impossible
to land. They floated down a short distance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
hoping to find a landing spot, but none could be
found. Then they attempted to cross the stream to
the other shore, hoping that the fire would not spread
in that direction. To their dismay they found that
they were already almost within the clutch of the
rapid. The current had become strong and swift,
and it was evident before they had got half-way
across the river that nothing but the hardest paddling
could keep them from being drawn into the
rapid. It was an occasion when everybody had to
look out for himself and depend on his own paddles
for safety. The young canoeists struck out manfully.
Harry was the first to reach the shore, where he
caught hold of the root of a tree and kept his canoe
stationary. Tom followed closely behind him, and
Harry told him to catch hold of the <i>Sunshine</i> until
he could make the <i>Twilight’s</i> painter fast to the root.
Joe arrived a little later, for his canoe had run on a
rock, and for a few minutes he was in great danger
of a capsize.</p>

<p>The three canoeists succeeded in tying up to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
bank, where they expected every moment to be joined
by Charley. The minutes passed on, but Charley
did not appear. His comrades shouted for him, but
there was no answer. Indeed, the rapid made such a
noise, now that they were close upon it, that they
could not have heard Charley’s voice had he been a
few yards from them.</p>

<p>The fear that an accident had happened to Charley
made the other boys very uneasy. Joe cast his canoe
loose and paddled out into the river and nearly across
it, looking for some signs of the <i>Midnight</i> and her
owner, but he came back unsuccessful, after having
narrowly escaped being carried down the rapid.
There could no longer be any doubt that the current
had swept the <i>Midnight</i> away, and that Charley had
been compelled to make the hazardous and almost
hopeless attempt of running the rapid in the dark.</p>

<p>As soon as Joe returned Harry said that he would
paddle out into the middle of the river where Charley
was last seen, and would let his canoe drift down the
rapid, but Tom and Joe insisted that he should do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
no such thing. Said Joe, “Either Charley is drowned
or he isn’t. If he isn’t drowned he is somewhere at
the foot of the rapid, where we’ll find him as soon
as it gets light. If he is drowned it won’t do him
any good for another of us to get drowned.”</p>

<p>“Joe is right,” said Tom. “We must stay here till
daylight.”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile Charley may be drowned!” exclaimed
Harry.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he is,” replied Tom. “He’s the
best canoeist of any of us, and he is too good a sailor
to get frightened. Then, he is very cautious, and I’ll
bet that the first thing he did when he found himself
in the rapid was to buckle his life-belt round him.”</p>

<p>“If he did that it wouldn’t hurt him if he were
capsized.”</p>

<p>“Not if the rapid is like those we’ve run, and the
chances are that it is. I feel sure that Charley has
got through it all right, and without losing his canoe.
We’ll find him waiting for us in the morning.”</p>

<p>What Tom said seemed so reasonable that Harry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
gave up his wild idea of running the rapid, and
agreed to wait until daylight. It was already nearly
one o’clock, and at that time of year the day began
to dawn by half-past three. There was no opportunity
for the boys to sleep, but they occasionally
nodded as they sat in their canoes. About two
o’clock Harry poked Tom with his paddle, and in a
low voice called his attention to the crackling of the
twigs in the woods a short distance from the bank.
Something was evidently making its way through
the forest and coming nearer every minute to the
canoes. The boys grasped their pistols and anxiously
waited. They remembered that there were bears
in the woods, and they fully believed that one was
on its way down to the water. “Don’t fire,” whispered
Harry, “till I give the word;” but while he
was speaking a dark form parted the underbrush on
the bank above them and came out into full view.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_VI"><span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">THE early morning visitor was not a bear. He
was a very welcome visitor, for as soon as he
made himself visible he was seen to be the missing
canoeist. Charley was very wet and cold, but he
was soon furnished with dry clothes and a blanket,
and warmed with a cup of hot coffee made with the
help of Harry’s spirit-lamp; and as he lay on the
bank and waited for daylight he told the story of
his midnight run down the rapid.</p>

<p>When the boys were crossing the river above the
rapid Charley’s canoe was close behind Joe’s. The
latter ran on a rock, and in order to avoid her Charley
was compelled to pass below the rock. In so
doing he found himself in great danger of running
on another rock, and in his effort to avoid this he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
drifted still farther down the river. Before he was
aware of his danger he was caught by the current at
the head of the rapid. He had just time to turn his
canoe so as to head her down stream and to buckle
his life-belt around him. In another second he was
rushing down the rapid at a rate that, in view of
the darkness, was really frightful.</p>

<p>It was useless to attempt to guide the canoe.
Charley could see so little in advance of him that he
could not choose his channel nor avoid any rock that
might lie in his path. He, therefore, sat still, trusting
that the current would carry him into the deepest
channel and keep him clear of the rocks. The
rapid seemed to be a very long one, but the <i>Midnight</i>
ran it without taking in a drop of water or
striking a single rock.</p>

<p>As soon as quiet water was reached Charley
paddled to the shore, intending to make his canoe
fast and to sleep quietly in her until morning. He
was in high spirits at having successfully run a rapid
in the dark, and he paddled so carelessly that just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
as he was within a yard of the shore the canoe ran
upon a sunken log, spilled her captain into the water,
and then floated off in the darkness and disappeared.</p>

<p>Charley had no difficulty in getting ashore, but he
was wet to the skin, and his dry clothes and all his
property, except his paddle, had gone on a cruise
without him. There was nothing for him to do but
to make his way back along the bank to the other
boys. This proved to be a tiresome task. The
woods were very thick, and full of underbrush and
fallen trunks. Charley was terribly scratched, and
his clothes badly torn, as he slowly forced his way
through the bushes and among the trees. He was
beginning to think that he would never reach the
boys, when he fortunately heard their voices as they
whispered together.</p>

<p>When morning dawned the canoeists, feeling extremely
cramped and stiff, cast their canoes loose,
and started down the river, intending, if possible, to
find Charley’s canoe, and then go ashore for breakfast
and a good long sleep. The rapid had been run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
so easily by Charley in the night that they rightly
imagined they would find no difficulty in running it
by daylight. Tom took Charley in the <i>Twilight</i>, and
the fleet, with Harry leading the way, passed through
the rapid without accident. The boys could not but
wonder how Charley had escaped the rocks in the
darkness, for the rapid, which was much the roughest
and swiftest they had yet seen, seemed to be full
of rocks.</p>

<p>Not very far below the rapid the missing canoe
was discovered aground in an eddy. She was uninjured;
and as there was a sandy beach and plenty
of shade near at hand the boys went ashore, made
their breakfast, and, lying down on their rubber
blankets, slept until the afternoon.</p>

<p class="center">RUNNING THE RAPID.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was time for dinner when the tired canoeists
awoke, and by the time they had finished their meal
and were once more afloat it was nearly three o’clock.
They ran three more rapids without any trouble.
Their canoes frequently struck on sunken rocks; but
as they were loaded so as to draw more water aft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
than they did forward, they usually struck aft of
midships, and did not swing around broadside to the
current. When a canoe struck in this way her captain
unjointed his paddle, and, taking a blade in each
hand, generally succeeded in lifting her clear of the
rock by pushing with both blades against the bottom
of the river. In the next rapid Joe’s canoe ran so
high on a rock that was in the full force of the current
that he could not get her afloat without getting
out of her. He succeeded in getting into her again,
however, without difficulty, by bringing her along-side
of the rock on which he was standing, although
he had to step in very quickly, as the current swept
her away the moment he ceased to hold her.</p>

<p>In running these rapids the canoes were kept at a
safe distance apart, so that when one ran aground
the one following her had time to steer clear of her.
At Charley’s suggestion the painter of each canoe
was rove through the stern-post instead of the stem-post.
By keeping the end of the painter in his hand
the canoeist whose canoe ran aground could jump<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
out and feel sure that the canoe could not run away
from him, and that he could not turn her broadside
to the stream by hauling on the painter, as would
have been the case had the painter been rove through
the stem-post.</p>

<p>“I want to see that Sherbrooke postmaster!” exclaimed
Joe, after running what was the seventh
rapid, counting from the dam at Magog. “He said
there were only one or two little rapids in this
river. Why, there isn’t anything but rapids in it!”</p>

<p>“There’s something else just ahead of us worse
than rapids,” said Charley. “Look at that smoke.”</p>

<p>Just a little distance below the fleet the river was
completely hidden by a dense cloud of smoke that
rested on the water and rose like a heavy fog-bank
above the tops of the highest trees. It was caused
by a fire in the woods&mdash;probably the very fire which
the boys had started on the previous night. How
far down the river the smoke extended, and whether
any one could breathe while in it, were questions of
great importance to the canoeists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>The fleet stopped just before reaching the smoke,
and the boys backed water gently with their paddles
while they discussed what they had better do. It
was of no use to go ashore with the hope of finding
how far the smoke extended, for it would have been
as difficult to breathe on shore as on the water.</p>

<p>“There’s one good thing about it,” said Charley:
“the smoke blows right across the river, so the
chances are that it does not extend very far down
stream.”</p>

<p>“We can’t hear the noise of any rapid,” said Harry,
“and that’s another good thing. There can’t be
a rapid of any consequence within the next quarter
of a mile.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do, with the Commodore’s
permission,” continued Charley. “There is
no use in staying here all day, for that smoke may
last for any length of time. I’ll tie a wet handkerchief
around my mouth and nose, and take the
chances of paddling through the smoke. It isn’t
as thick close to the water as it looks to be, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
haven’t the least doubt that I can run through it
all right.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you get choked with smoke, or get
into a dangerous rapid?” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any rapid near us, or we would hear
it, and I don’t think the smoke will hurt me while
I breathe through a wet handkerchief. At any
rate, I’d rather try it than sit here and wait for
the smoke to disappear.”</p>

<p>It was decided, after farther discussion, that Charley
should attempt to paddle through the smoke, if
he really wished to do so; and that he should blow
a whistle if he got through all right, and thought
that the other boys could safely follow his example.
Paddling a little way up stream, so as to have room
to get up his fastest rate of speed before reaching
the smoke, Charley started on his hazardous trip.
He disappeared in the smoke with his canoe rushing
along at a tremendous rate, and in a few seconds
his comrades heard him calling to them to come on
without fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>They followed Charley’s example in covering their
mouths and noses with wet handkerchiefs, and in
paddling at the top of their speed. They were
agreeably surprised to find that the belt of smoke
was only a few yards wide, and that almost before
they had begun to find any difficulty in breathing
they emerged into pure air and sunlight.</p>

<p>“It was a risky business for you, Charley,” said
Harry, “for the smoke might have covered the river
for the next quarter of a mile.”</p>

<p>“But then it didn’t, you see,” replied Charley.
“How cheap we should have felt if we had waited
till morning for the smoke to blow away, and then
found that we could have run through it as easily
as we have done!”</p>

<p>“Still, I say it was risky.”</p>

<p>“Well, admitting that it was, what then? We
can’t go canoeing unless we are ready to take risks
occasionally. If nobody is ever to take a risk, there
ought not to be any canoes, or ships, or railroads.”</p>

<p>“That Sherbrooke postmaster isn’t afraid to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
risks,” observed Joe. “If he keeps on telling canoeists
that there are no rapids in this river, some
of these days he’ll have an accident with a large
canoeist and a heavy paddle. We’ve run seven
rapids already, and have another one ahead of us.
If we ever get to Sherbrooke, I think it will be our
duty to consider whether that postmaster ought to
be allowed to live any longer.”</p>

<p>Just before sunset the fleet reached Magog Lake,
a placid sheet of water about four miles long, with
three or four houses scattered along its eastern
shore. At one of these houses eggs, milk, butter,
bread, a chicken, and a raspberry pie were bought,
and the boys went into camp near the lower end
of the lake. After a magnificent supper they went
to bed rather proud of their achievements during
the last day and night.</p>

<p>The next day the canoeists started in the cool of
the morning, and as soon as they left the lake found
themselves at the head of their eighth rapid. All
that day they paddled down the river, running rapids<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
every little while, jumping overboard when their
canoes ran aground and refused to float, and occasionally
slipping on the smooth rocky bottom of
the stream and sitting down violently in the water.
Once they came to a dam, over which the canoes
had to be lowered, and on the brink of which Joe
slipped and slid with awful swiftness into the pool
below, from which he escaped with no other injury
than torn trousers and wet clothes.</p>

<p>“That postmaster said there were no dams in the
Magog, didn’t he?” asked Joe as he prepared to get
into his canoe. “Well, I hope he hasn’t any family.”</p>

<p>“Why, what about his family?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“Nothing; only I’m going to try to get him to
come down the Magog in a canoe, so he can see
what a nice run it is. I suppose his body will be
found some time, unless the bears get at him.”</p>

<p>“That’s all rubbish, Joe,” said Charley. “We
wouldn’t have had half the fun we’ve had if there
hadn’t been any rapids in the river. We’re none
the worse for getting a little wet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“We might have had less fun, but then I’d have
had more trousers if it hadn’t been for that dam.
I like fun as well as anybody, but I can’t land at
Sherbrooke with these trousers.”</p>

<p>“I see Sherbrooke now!” exclaimed Harry; “so
you’d better change your clothes while you have a
chance.”</p>

<p>Sherbrooke was coming rapidly into sight as the
fleet paddled down the stream, and in the course
of half an hour the boys landed in the village, near
a dam which converted the swift Magog into a lazy
little pond. While his comrades drew the canoes
out of the water and made them ready to be carted
to the St. Francis, Harry went to engage a cart.
He soon returned with a big wagon large enough
to take two canoes at once; and it was not long
before the fleet was resting in the shade on the
bank of the St. Francis, and surrounded by a crowd
of inquisitive men, boys, and girls.</p>

<p>It was difficult to convince the men that the canoes
had actually come from Lake Memphremagog<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
by the river, and the boys were made very proud
of their success in running rapids which, the men
declared, could only be run in skiffs during a freshet.
Without an exception all the men agreed that there
were rapids in the St. Francis which were really
impassable, and that it would be foolish for the
boys to think of descending that river. After making
careful inquiries, and convincing themselves that
the men were in earnest, the canoeists retired some
distance from the crowd and held a council.</p>

<p>“The question is,” said Harry, “shall we try the
St. Francis after what we have heard? The youngest
officer present will give his opinion first. What
do you say, Joe?”</p>

<p>“I think I’ve had rapids and dams enough,” replied
Joe; “and I’d rather try some river where we
can sail. I vote against the St. Francis.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything the rest of you like; but I think
we’d better give the St. Francis up.”</p>

<p>“Now, Charley, how do you vote?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“For going down the St. Francis. I don’t believe
these men know much about the river, or anything
about canoes. Let’s stick to our original plan.”</p>

<p>“There are two votes against the St. Francis, and
one for it,” said Harry. “I don’t want to make a
tie, so I’ll vote with the majority. Boys, we won’t
go down the St. Francis, but we’ll go to the hotel,
stay there over Sunday, and decide where we will
cruise next.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joe, going to his canoe, and taking
a paddle blade in his hand.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you going to take that
paddle to the hotel for?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see the postmaster who said there
were no rapids in the Magog or the St. Francis;
that’s all,” replied Joe. “I’ve a painful duty to perform,
and I’m going to perform it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_VII"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">A COUNCIL was held at the hotel, and a dozen
different water-routes were discussed. As the
boys still wanted to carry out their original design
of making a voyage to Quebec, they decided to take
the canoes by rail to Rouse’s Point, and from thence
to descend the Richelieu River to the St. Lawrence.
The railway journey would take nearly a whole day,
but they thought it would be a rather pleasant
change from the close confinement of canoeing. For
it must be admitted that, delightful as they had
found canoeing to be, the task of sitting for hours in
the cockpit of a canoe with scarcely a possibility of
materially changing one’s position was tiresome, and
the boys, after a night’s sleep at the Sherbrooke
hotel, felt decidedly stiff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>As it would have taken three days to send the canoes
to Rouse’s Point by freight, the canoeists were
compelled to take them on the same train with themselves.
They went to the express office on Monday
morning and tried to make a bargain with the express
company. The agent astonished them by the
enormous price which he demanded, and Harry, who
acted as spokesman for the expedition, told him that
it was outrageous to ask such a price for carrying
four light canoes.</p>

<p>The man turned to a book in which were contained
the express company’s rates of charges, and
showed Harry that there was a fixed rate for row-boats
and shells.</p>

<p>“But,” said Harry, “a canoe is not a row-boat nor
a shell. What justice is there in charging as much
for a fourteen-foot canoe as for a forty-foot shell?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the agent, “I dunno as it would be
fair. But, then, these canoes of yours are pretty
near as big as row-boats.”</p>

<p>“A canoe loaded as ours are don’t weigh over one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
hundred and ten pounds. How much does a row-boat
weigh?”</p>

<p>“Well, about two or three hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>“Then, is it fair to charge as much for a canoe as
for a row-boat, that weighs three times as much?”</p>

<p>The agent found it difficult to answer this argument,
and after thinking the matter over he agreed
to take the canoes at half the rate ordinarily charged
for row-boats. The boys were pleased with their
victory over him, but they still felt that to be compelled
to pay four times as much for the canoes as
they paid for their own railroad-tickets was an imposition.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the train rolled into the Sherbrooke
station. To the great disappointment of the boys,
no express-car was attached to it, the only place for
express packages being a small compartment twelve
feet long at one end of the smoking-car. It was obvious
that canoes fourteen feet long could not go into
a space only twelve feet long, and it seemed as if
it would be necessary to wait twelve hours for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
night-train, to which a large express-car was always
attached. But the conductor of the train was a man
who could sympathize with boys, and who had ideas
of his own. He uncoupled the engine, which was immediately
in front of the smoking-car, and then had
the canoes taken in through the door of the smoking-car
and placed on the backs of the seats. Very little
room was left for passengers who wanted to smoke;
but as there were only four or five of these they
made no complaint. The canoes, with blankets under
them, to protect the backs of the seats, rode
safely, and when, late in the afternoon, Rouse’s Point,
was reached, they were taken out of the car without
a scratch.</p>

<p>There was just time enough before sunset to paddle
a short distance below the fort, where a camping-ground
was found that would have been very pleasant
had there been fewer mosquitoes. They were
the first Canadian mosquitoes that had made the acquaintance
of the young canoeists, and they seemed
to be delighted. They sung and buzzed in quiet excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and fairly drove the boys from their supper
to the shelter of the canoes.</p>

<p>Harry had a long piece of mosquito-netting, which
he threw over the top of his canoe-tent, and which
fell over the openings on each side of the tent, thus
protecting the occupant of the canoe from mosquitoes
without depriving him of air. None of the other
boys had taken the trouble to bring mosquito-netting
with them, except Charley, who had a sort of
mosquito-netting bag, which he drew over his head,
and which prevented the mosquitoes from getting at
his face and neck.</p>

<p>As for Joe and Tom, the mosquitoes fell upon
them with great enthusiasm, and soon reduced them
to a most miserable condition. Tom was compelled
to cover his head with his India-rubber blanket, and
was nearly suffocated. Joe managed to tie a handkerchief
over his face in such a way as to allow himself
air enough to breathe, and at the same time to
keep off the mosquitoes. Instead of covering the rest
of his body with his blanket, he deliberately exposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
a bare arm and part of a bare leg, in hopes that he
could thus satisfy the mosquitoes and induce them to
be merciful. At the end of half an hour both Tom
and Joe felt that they could endure the attacks of
the insatiable insects no longer. They got up, and,
stirring the embers of the fire, soon started a cheerful
blaze. There were plenty of hemlock-trees close at
hand, and the hemlock-boughs when thrown on the
fire gave out a great deal of smoke. The two unfortunate
boys sat in the lee of the fire and nearly
choked themselves with smoke; but they could endure
the smoke better than the mosquitoes, and so
they were left alone by the latter. In the course of
the next hour a breeze sprung up, which blew the
mosquitoes away, and the sleepy and nearly stifled
boys were permitted to go to bed and to sleep.</p>

<p class="center">GETTING BREAKFAST UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wind died down before morning, and the mosquitoes
returned. As soon as it was light the canoeists
made haste to get breakfast and to paddle out
into the stream. The mosquitoes let them depart
without attempting to follow them; and the boys,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
anchoring the canoes by making the ballast-bags fast
to the painters, enjoyed an unmolested bath. As
they were careful to anchor where the water was not
quite four feet deep they had no difficulty in climbing
into the canoes after the bath. Joe’s mishap on
Lake Memphremagog had taught them that getting
into a canoe in deep water was easier in theory than
in practice.</p>

<p>Later in the morning the usual southerly breeze,
which is found almost every morning on the Richelieu,
gave the canoeists the opportunity of making
sail&mdash;an opportunity that was all the more welcome
since the cruise down the Magog had been exclusively
a paddling cruise. The breeze was just fresh
enough to make it prudent for the canoes to carry
their main-sails only, and to give the canoeists plenty
of employment in watching the gusts that came
through the openings in the woods that lined the
western shore.</p>

<p>About twelve miles below Rouse’s Point the fleet
reached “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ile aux Noix</span>,” a beautiful island, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
middle of the stream, with a somewhat dilapidated
fort at its northern end. The boys landed and examined
the fort, and the ruined barracks which stood
near it. The ditch surrounding the fort was half
filled with the wooden palisades which had rotted
and fallen into it, and large trees had sprung up on
the grassy slope of the outer wall. The interior was,
however, in good repair, and in one of the granite
casemates lived an Irishman and his wife, who were
the entire garrison. In former years the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ile aux
Noix</span>” fort was one of the most important defences
of the Canadian frontier, and even in its present forlorn
condition it could be defended much longer
than could the big American fort at Rouse’s Point.
The boys greatly enjoyed their visit to the island,
and after lunch set sail, determined to make the most
of the fair wind and to reach St. John before night.</p>

<p>The breeze held, and in less than three hours the
steeples and the railway bridge of St. John came in
view. The canoeists landed at the upper end of the
town; and Harry and Charley, leaving the canoes in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
charge of the other boys, went in search of the Custom-house
officer whose duty it was to inspect all
vessels passing from the United States into Canada
by way of the Richelieu River. Having found the
officer, who was a very pleasant man, and who gave
the fleet permission to proceed on its way without
searching the canoes for smuggled goods, Harry and
Charley walked on to examine the rapids, which begin
just below the railway bridge. From St. John to
Chambly, a distance of twelve miles, the river makes
a rapid descent, and is entirely unnavigable for anything
except canoes. A canal around the rapids enables
canal boats and small vessels to reach the river
at Chambly, where it again becomes navigable; but
the boys did not like the idea of paddling through
the canal, and greatly preferred to run the rapids.</p>

<p>The first rapid was a short but rough one. Still,
it was no worse than the first of the Magog rapids,
and Harry and Charley made up their minds that it
could be safely run. The men of whom they made
inquiries as to the rapids farther down said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
they were impassable, and that the canoes had better
pass directly into the canal, without attempting to
run even the first rapid. Harry was inclined to
think that this advice was good, but Charley pointed
out that it would be possible to drag the canoes up
the bank of the river and launch them in the canal
at any point between St. John and Chambly, and
that it would be time enough to abandon the river
when it should really prove to be impassable.</p>

<p>Returning to the canoes, the Commodore gave the
order to prepare to run the rapids. In a short time
the fleet, with the <i>Sunshine</i> in advance, passed under
the bridge; and narrowly escaping shipwreck on the
remains of the wooden piles that once supported a
bridge that had been destroyed by fire, entered the
rapid. There was quite a crowd gathered to watch
the canoes as they passed, but those people who
wanted the excitement of seeing the canoes wrecked
were disappointed. Not a drop of water found its
way into the cockpit of a single canoe; and though
there was an ugly rock near the end of the rapid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
against which each canoeist fully expected to be
driven as he approached it, the run was made without
the slightest accident.</p>

<p>Drifting down with the current a mile or two below
the town, the boys landed and encamped for
the night. While waiting at St. John, Joe and Tom
had provided themselves with mosquito-netting, but
they had little use for it, for only a few mosquitoes
made the discovery that four healthy and attractive
boys were within reach. The night was cool
and quiet, and the canoeists, tired with their long
day’s work, slept until late in the morning.</p>

<p>Everything was prepared the next day for running
the rapids which the men at St. John had declared
to be impassable. The spars and all the stores were
lashed fast; the sand-bags were placed in the after-compartments;
the painters were rove through the
stern-posts, and the life-belts were placed where they
could be buckled on at an instant’s notice. After
making all these preparations it was rather disappointing
to find no rapids whatever between St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
John and Chambly, or rather the Chambly railway
bridge.</p>

<p>“It just proves what I said yesterday,” remarked
Charley, turning round in his canoe to speak to his
comrades, who were a boat’s length behind him.
“People who live on the banks of a river never
know anything about it. Now, I don’t believe there
is a rapid in the whole Richelieu River, except at
St. John. Halloo! keep back, boys&mdash;”</p>

<p>While he was speaking Charley and his canoe disappeared
as suddenly as if the earth, or rather the
water, had opened and swallowed them. The other
boys in great alarm backed water, and then paddling
ashore as fast as possible, sprung out of their canoes
and ran along the shore, to discover what had become
of Charley. They found him at the foot of a
water-fall of about four feet in height over which he
had been carried. The fall was formed by a long
ledge of rock running completely across the river;
and had the boys been more careful, and had the
wind been blowing in any other direction than directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
down the river, they would have heard the
sound of the falling water in time to be warned of
the danger into which Charley had carelessly run.</p>

<p>His canoe had sustained little damage, for it had
luckily fallen where the water was deep enough to
keep it from striking the rocky bottom. Charley had
been thrown out as the canoe went over the fall, but
had merely bruised himself a little. He towed his
canoe ashore, and in answer to a mischievous question
from Joe admitted that perhaps the men who
had said that the Chambly rapids were impassable
were right.</p>

<p>Below the fall and as far as the eye could reach
stretched a fierce and shallow rapid. The water
boiled over and among the rocks with which it was
strewn, and there could not be any doubt that the
rapid was one which could not be successfully run,
unless, perhaps, by some one perfectly familiar with
the channel. It was agreed that the canoes must be
carried up to the canal, and after two hours of hard
work the fleet was launched a short distance above
one of the canal locks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>The lock-man did not seem disposed to let the canoes
pass through the lock, but finally accepted fifty
cents, and, grumbling to himself in his Canadian
French, proceeded to lock the canoes through. He
paid no attention to the request that he would open
the sluices gradually, but opened them all at once
and to their fullest extent. The result was that the
water in the lock fell with great rapidity; the canoes
were swung against one another and against
the side of the lock, and Charley’s canoe, catching
against a bolt in one of the upper gates, was capsized
and sunk to the bottom, leaving her captain
clinging to the stern of the <i>Sunshine</i>.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_VIII"><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">THERE is no place more unfit for a sudden and
unexpected bath than the lock of a canal. The
sides and the gates are perpendicular and smooth,
and present nothing to which a person in the water
can cling. Charley had no difficulty in supporting
himself by throwing one arm over the stern of Harry’s
canoe, but had he been alone in the lock he
would have been in a very unpleasant position.</p>

<p>As soon as the gates were opened the boys paddled
out of the lock, and went ashore to devise a
plan for raising the sunken canoe. Of course it was
necessary that some one should dive and bring up
the painter, so that the canoe could be dragged out
of the lock; but, as canal-boats were constantly
passing, it was a full hour before any attempt at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
diving could be made. There were half a dozen
small French boys playing near the lock, and Charley,
who was by no means anxious to do any unnecessary
diving, hired them to get the canoe ashore,
which they managed to do easily. It was then
found that nearly everything except the spars had
floated out of her, and the rest of the morning was
spent in searching for the missing articles in the
muddy bottom of the canal. Most of them were recovered,
but Charley’s spare clothes, which were in
an India-rubber bag, could not be found.</p>

<p>This was the second time that the unfortunate
<i>Midnight</i> had foundered, and Charley was thoroughly
convinced of the necessity of providing some means
of keeping her afloat in case of capsizing. It was impossible
for him to put water-tight compartments in
her, such as the <i>Sunshine</i> and the <i>Dawn</i> possessed,
but he resolved to buy a dozen beef-bladders at the
next town, and after blowing them up to pack them
in the bow and stern of his canoe. Tom, whose
“Rice Lake” canoe was also without water-tight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
compartments, agreed to adopt Charley’s plan, and
thus avoid running the risk of an accident that
might result in the loss of the canoe and cargo.</p>

<p>When the fleet finally got under way again
there was a nice breeze from the south, which sent
the canoes along at the rate of four or five miles an
hour. Chambly, the northern end of the canal, was
reached before four o’clock, the boys having lunched
on bread-and-water while in the canoes in order not
to lose time by going ashore. They passed safely
through the three great locks at Chambly; and entering
the little lake formed by the expansion of the
river, and known as Chambly Basin, they skirted its
northern shore until they reached the ruins of Chambly
Castle.</p>

<p>More than one hundred and fifty years ago the
Frenchmen built the great square fort, with round
towers at each angle, which is now called Chambly
Castle. At that time the only direct way of communication
between the settlements on the St. Lawrence
and those in the valleys of the Hudson and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the Mohawk was up the Richelieu River, Lake
Champlain, and Lake George. It was this route that
Burgoyne followed when he began the campaign
that ended so disastrously for him at Saratoga, and
it was at Chambly Castle that he formally took command
of his army. The castle was placed just at
the foot of the rapids, on a broad, level space, where
Indians used to assemble in large numbers to trade
with the French. Its high stone walls, while they
could easily have been knocked to pieces by cannon,
were a complete protection against the arrows and
rifles of the savages, and could have withstood a long
siege by any English force not provided with artillery.
In the old days when the castle was garrisoned
by gay young French officers, and parties of beautiful
ladies came up from Montreal to attend the officers’
balls, and the gray old walls echoed to music, and
brilliant lights flashed through the windows, the Indians
encamped outside the gates must have thought
it the most magnificent and brilliant place in the
whole world. Now there is nothing left of it but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the four walls and the crumbling towers. The iron
bolts on which the great castle gate once swung are
still embedded in the stone, but nothing else remains
inside the castle except grassy mounds and the wild
vines that climb wherever they can find an angle or
a stone to cling to.</p>

<p>The canoeists made their camp where the Indians
had so often camped before them, and after supper
they rambled through the castle and climbed to the
top of one of the towers. They had never heard of
its existence, and were as surprised as they were delighted
to find so romantic a ruin.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least doubt that the place is full of
ghosts,” said Charley as the boys were getting into
the canoes for the night.</p>

<p>“Do you really believe in ghosts?” asked Tom, in
his matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Charley, “when you think of what
must have happened inside of that old castle and
outside of it when the Indians tortured their prisoners,
there can’t help but be ghosts here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care, provided there are no mosquitoes,”
said Joe. “Ghosts don’t bite, and don’t sing in a
fellow’s ears.”</p>

<p>Any one who has camped near a rapid knows how
strangely the running water sounds in the stillness
of the night. Joe, who, although there were no mosquitoes
to trouble him, could not fall asleep, was sure
that he heard men’s voices talking in a low tone, and
two or three times raised himself up in his canoe to
see if there were any persons in sight. He became
convinced after a while that the sounds which disturbed
him were made by the water, but, nevertheless,
they had made him rather nervous. Though he
had professed not to be afraid of ghosts, he did not
like to think about them, but he could not keep
them out of his mind. Once, when he looked out of
his canoe toward the castle, he was startled to find
it brilliantly lighted up. The light was streaming
from the casemates, loop-holes, and windows, and it
was some moments before he comprehended that it
was nothing more ghostly than moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>Toward midnight Joe fell asleep, but he slept uneasily.
He woke up suddenly to find a dark object
with two fiery eyes seated on the deck of his canoe
and apparently watching him. He sprung up, with
a cry of terror, which awakened his comrades. The
strange object rushed away from the canoe, and, stopping
near the gate of the castle, seemed to be waiting
to see what the boys would do.</p>

<p>By this time Joe had recovered his senses, and
knew that his strange visitor was a wild animal.
The boys took their pistols. Tom, who was the best
shot, fired at the animal. He did not hit it, but as
Tom advanced slowly toward it the creature went
into the castle.</p>

<p>“It’s a wild-cat,” cried Charley. “I saw it as it
crossed that patch of moonlight. Come on, boys,
and we’ll have a hunt.”</p>

<p>With their pistols ready for instant service, the
canoeists rushed into the castle. The wild-cat was
seated on a pile of stones in what was once the court-yard,
and did not show any signs of fear. Three or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
four pistol-shots, however, induced it to spring down
from its perch and run across the court-yard. The
boys followed it eagerly, plunging into a thick
growth of tall weeds, and shouting at the top of
their lungs. Suddenly the animal vanished; and
though Tom fancied that he saw it crouching in the
shadow of the wall and fired at it, as he supposed, he
soon found that he was firing at a piece of old stovepipe
that had probably been brought to the place
by a picnic party.</p>

<p>Giving up the hunt with reluctance, the canoeists
returned to their canoes; at least, three of them did,
but Joe was not with them. They called to him,
but received no answer, and becoming anxious about
him, went back to the castle and shouted his name
loudly, but without success.</p>

<p>“It’s very strange,” exclaimed Charley. “He was
close behind me when we chased the wild-cat into
those weeds.”</p>

<p>“Has anybody seen him since?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class="center">HUNTING FOR A WILD-CAT IN CHAMBLY CASTLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nobody had seen him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“Then,” said Harry, “the wild-cat has carried him
off, or killed him.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Charley; “a wild-cat isn’t a
tiger, and couldn’t carry off a small baby. Joe must
be trying to play a trick on us.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back and pay no attention to him,” suggested
Tom. “I don’t like such tricks.”</p>

<p>“There’s no trick about it,” said Harry. “Joe
isn’t that kind of fellow. Something has happened
to him, and we’ve got to look for him till we find
him.”</p>

<p>“Harry’s right,” said Charley. “Go and get the
lantern out of my canoe, won’t you, Tom? I’ve got
matches in my pocket.”</p>

<p>When the lantern was lit a careful search was
made all over the court-yard. Harry was greatly
frightened, for he was afraid that Joe might have
been accidentally shot while the boys were shooting
at the wild-cat, and he remembered that in his excitement
he had fired his pistol in a very reckless way.
It was horrible to think that he might have shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
poor Joe; worse, even, than thinking that the wild-cat
might have seized him.</p>

<p>The court-yard had been thoroughly searched
without finding the least trace of Joe, and the boys
were becoming more and more alarmed, when Charley,
whose ears were particularly sharp, cried, “Hush!
I hear something.” They all listened intently, and
heard a voice faintly calling “Help!” They knew
at once that it was Joe’s voice, but they could not
imagine where he was. They shouted in reply to
him, and Charley, seizing the lantern, carefully pushed
aside the tall weeds and presently found himself at
the mouth of a well.</p>

<p>“Are you there, Joe?” he cried, lying down on the
ground, with his head over the mouth of the well.</p>

<p>“I believe I am,” replied Joe. “I’m ready to come
out, though, if you fellows will help me.”</p>

<p>The boys gave a great shout of triumph.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked Charley, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am; but I think somebody will
be if I have to stay here much longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>It was evident that Joe was not seriously hurt,
although he had fallen into the well while rushing
recklessly after the wild-cat. Tom and Harry ran to
the canoes and returned with all four of the canoe-painters.
Tying one of them to the lantern, Charley
lowered it down, and was able to get a glimpse of
Joe. The well was about twenty feet deep, and perfectly
dry, and Joe was standing, with his hands in
his pockets, leaning against the side of the well, and
apparently entirely unhurt, in spite of his fall.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_IX"><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">IT was an easy matter to help Joe out of the old
well. He had fallen into it while running after
the wild-cat, but a heap of decayed leaves at the
bottom broke the fall and saved him from any serious
injury. Nevertheless, he must have been a little
stunned at first, for he made no outcry for some time,
and it was his first call for help that was heard by
Charley.</p>

<p>The boys returned to their canoes, and, as it was
not yet midnight, prepared to resume the sleep from
which they had been so unceremoniously awakened.
They had little fear that the wild-cat would pay
them another visit, for it had undoubtedly been badly
frightened. Still, it was not pleasant to think that
there was a wild beast within a few rods of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
and the thought kept the canoeists awake for a long
time.</p>

<p>The wild-cat did not pay them a second visit, and
when they awoke the next morning they were half
inclined to think that their night’s adventure had
been only a dream. There, however, were the marks
made by its claws on the varnished deck of Joe’s
canoe, and Joe’s clothing was torn and stained by
his fall. With the daylight they became very courageous,
and decided that they had never been in the
least afraid of the animal. The so-called wild-cat of
Canada, which is really a lynx, is, however, a fierce
and vicious animal, and is sometimes more than a
match for an unarmed man.</p>

<p>There was a strong west wind blowing when the
fleet started, and Chambly Basin was covered with
white-caps. As the canoes were sailing in the trough
of the sea they took in considerable water while
skirting the east shore of the Basin, but once in the
narrow river they found the water perfectly smooth.
This day the fleet made better progress than on any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
previous day. Nothing could be more delightful
than the scenery, and the quaint little French towns
along the river, every one of which was named after
some saint, were very interesting. The boys landed
at one of them and got their dinner at a little tavern
where no one spoke English, and where Charley,
who had studied French at Annapolis, won the admiration
of his comrades by the success with which
he ordered the dinner.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">SAILING DOWN THE RICHELIEU RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the exception of the hour spent at dinner,
the canoeists sailed, from six o’clock in the morning
until seven at night, at the rate of nearly six miles
an hour. The clocks of Sorel, the town at the mouth
of the Richelieu, were striking six as the canoes
glided into the broad St. Lawrence and steered for a
group of islands distant about a mile from the south
shore. It was while crossing the St. Lawrence that
they first made the acquaintance of screw-steamers,
and learned how dangerous they are to the careless
canoeist. A big steamship, on her way to Montreal,
came up the river so noiselessly that the boys did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
not notice her until they heard her hoarse whistle
warning them to keep out of her way. A paddle-wheel
steamer can be heard while she is a long way
off, but screw-steamers glide along so stealthily that
the English canoeists, who constantly meet them on
the Mersey, the Clyde, and the lower Thames, have
nicknamed them “sudden death.”</p>

<p>Cramped and tired were the canoeists when they
reached the nearest island and went ashore to prepare
a camp, but they were proud of having sailed
sixty miles in one day. As they sat around the fire
after supper Harry said, “Boys, we’ve had experience
enough by this time to test our different rigs. Let’s
talk about them a little.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joe. “I want it understood, however,
that my lateen is by all odds the best rig in
the fleet.”</p>

<p>“Charley,” remarked Tom, “you said the other
day that you liked Joe’s rig better than any other.
Do you think so still?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” answered Charley. “Joe’s sails<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
set flatter than any lug-sail; he can set them and
take them in quicker than we can handle ours, and
as they are triangular he has the most of his canvas
at the foot of the sail instead of at the head. But
they’re going to spill him before the cruise is over,
or I’m mistaken.”</p>

<p>“In what way?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“You are going to get yourself into a scrape some
day by trying to take in your sail when you are running
before a stiff breeze. If you try to get the sail
down without coming up into the wind it will get
overboard, and either you will lose it or it will capsize
you; you tried it yesterday when a squall came
up, and you very nearly came to grief.”</p>

<p>“But you can say the same about any other rig,”
exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t very well get any sail down
while the wind is in it; but Tom can take in his
sharpie-sail without much danger even when he’s
running directly before the wind, and Harry and I
can let go our halyards and get our lugs down after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
a fashion, if it is necessary. Still, your lateen is the
best cruising rig I’ve ever seen, though for racing
Harry’s big, square-headed balance-lug is better.”</p>

<p>“You may say what you will,” said Tom, “but give
me my sharpie-sails. They set as flat as a board, and
I can handle them easily enough to suit me.”</p>

<p>“The trouble with your rig,” said Charley, “is that
you have a mast nearly fifteen feet high. Now, when
Joe takes in his main-sail he has only two feet of
mast left standing.”</p>

<p>“How do you like your own rig?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is good enough. I’m not sure that it isn’t
better than either yours or Tom’s; but it certainly
isn’t as handy as Joe’s lateen.”</p>

<p>“Now that you’ve settled that I’ve the best rig,”
said Joe, “you’d better admit that I’ve the best
canoe, and then turn in for the night. After the
work we’ve done to-day, and the fun we had last
night, I’m sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Do you call sitting still in a canoe hard work?”
inquired Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“Is falling down a well your idea of fun?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“It’s too soon,” said Charley, “to decide who has
the best canoe. We’ll find that out by the time the
cruise is over.”</p>

<p>The island where the boys camped during their
first night on the St. Lawrence was situated at the
head of Lake St. Peter. This lake is simply an expansion
of the St. Lawrence, and though it is thirty
miles long and about ten miles wide at its widest
part, it is so shallow that steamboats can only pass
through it by following an artificial channel dredged
out by the government at a vast expense. Its shores
are lined with a thick growth of reeds, which extend
in many places fully a mile into the lake, and are
absolutely impassable, except where streams flowing
into the lake have kept channels open through the
reeds.</p>

<p>On leaving the island in the morning the canoeists
paddled down the lake, for there was not a breath of
wind. The sun was intensely hot, and the heat reflected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
from the surface of the water and the varnished
decks of the canoes assisted in making the
boys feel as if they were roasting before a fire. Toward
noon the heat became really intolerable, and
the Commodore gave the order to paddle over to
the north shore in search of shade.</p>

<p>It was disappointing to find instead of a shady
shore an impenetrable barrier of reeds. After resting
a little while in the canoes, the boys started to
skirt the reeds, in hope of finding an opening; and
the sun, apparently taking pity on them, went under
a cloud, so that they paddled a mile or two in comparative
comfort.</p>

<p>The friendly cloud was followed before long by a
mass of thick black clouds coming up from the south.
Soon the thunder was heard in the distance, and it
dawned upon the tired boys that they were about to
have a thunder-storm, without any opportunity of
obtaining shelter.</p>

<p>They paddled steadily on, looking in vain for a
path through the reeds, and making up their minds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
to a good wetting. They found, however, that the
rain did not come alone. With it came a fierce gust
of wind, which quickly raised white-caps on the lake.
Instead of dying out as soon as the rain fell the wind
blew harder and harder, and in the course of half an
hour there was a heavy sea running.</p>

<p>The wind and sea coming from the south, while
the canoes were steering east, placed the boys in a
very dangerous position. The seas struck the canoes
on the side and broke over them, and in spite of the
aprons, which to some extent protected the cockpits
of all except the <i>Twilight</i>, the water found its way
below. It was soon no longer possible to continue
in the trough of the sea, and the canoes were compelled
to turn their bows to the wind and sea&mdash;the
boys paddling just sufficiently to keep themselves
from drifting back into the reeds.</p>

<p>The <i>Sunshine</i> and the <i>Midnight</i> behaved admirably,
taking very little water over their decks. The
<i>Twilight</i> “slapped” heavily, and threw showers of
spray over herself, while the <i>Dawn</i> showed a tendency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
to dive bodily into the seas, and several times
the whole of her forward of the cockpit was under
the water.</p>

<p>“What had we better do?” asked Harry, who, although
Commodore, had the good-sense always to
consult Charley in matters of seamanship.</p>

<p>“It’s going to blow hard, and we can’t sit here and
paddle against it all day without getting exhausted.”</p>

<p>“But how are we going to help ourselves?” continued
Harry.</p>

<p>“Your canoe and mine,” replied Charley, “can live
out the gale well enough under sail. If we set our
main-sails close-reefed, and keep the canoes close to
the wind, we shall be all right. It’s the two other
canoes that I’m troubled about.”</p>

<p>“My canoe suits me well enough,” said Joe, “so
long as she keeps on the top of the water, but she
seems to have made up her mind to dive under it.”</p>

<p>“Mine would be all right if I could stop paddling
long enough to bail her out, but I can’t,” remarked
Tom. “She’s nearly half full of water now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“We can’t leave the other fellows,” said Harry,
“so what’s the use of our talking about getting sail
on our canoes?”</p>

<p>“It’s just possible that Tom’s canoe would live
under sail,” resumed Charley; “but it’s certain that
Joe’s won’t. What do you think about those reeds,
Tom&mdash;can you get your canoe into them?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can, and that’s what we’d better all
do,” exclaimed Tom. “The reeds will break the force
of the seas, and we can stay among them till the
wind goes down.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you try it,” suggested Charley, “and let
us see how far you can get into the reeds? I think
they’re going to help us out of a very bad scrape.”</p>

<p>Tom did not dare to turn his canoe around, so he
backed water and went at the reeds stern-first. They
parted readily, and his canoe penetrated without
much difficulty some half-dozen yards into the reeds
where the water was almost quiet. Unfortunately,
he shipped one heavy sea just as he entered the
reeds, which filled his canoe so full that another such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
sea would certainly have sunk her, had she not been
provided with the bladders bought at Chambly.</p>

<p>Joe followed Tom’s example, but the <i>Dawn</i> perversely
stuck in the reeds just as she was entering
them, and sea after sea broke over her before Joe
could drive her far enough into the reeds to be protected
by them.</p>

<p>Joe and Tom were now perfectly safe, though miserably
wet; but, as the rain had ceased, there was
nothing to prevent them from getting dry clothes
out of their water-proof bags, and putting them on
as soon as they could bail the water out of their canoes.
Harry and Charley, seeing their comrades in
safety, made haste to get up sail and to stand out
into the lake&mdash;partly because they did not want to
run the risk of being swamped when entering the
reeds, and partly because they wanted the excitement
of sailing in a gale of wind.</p>

<p>When the masts were stepped, the sails hoisted,
and the sheets trimmed, the two canoes, sailing close
to the wind, began to creep away from the reeds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
They behaved wonderfully well. The boys had to
watch them closely, and to lean out to windward
from time to time to hold them right side up.
The rudders were occasionally thrown out of the
water, but the boys took the precaution to steer
with their paddles. The excitement of sailing was
so great, that Charley and Harry forgot all about
the time, and sailed on for hours. Suddenly they
discovered that it was three o’clock, that they had
had no lunch, and that the two canoeists who had
sought refuge in the reeds had absolutely nothing
to eat with them. Filled with pity, they resolved
to return to them without a moment’s delay. It
was then that it occurred to them that in order to
sail back they must turn their canoes around, bringing
them while so doing in the trough of the sea.
Could they possibly do this without being swamped?
The question was a serious one, for they were fully
four miles from the shore, and the wind and sea
were as high as ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_X"><span class="smcap">Chapter X.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">CHARLEY and Harry took in their sails, keeping
the canoes head to sea with an occasional stroke
of the paddle. When all was made snug, and the
moment for turning the canoes had arrived, they
realized that they were about to attempt the most
hazardous feat of the whole cruise.</p>

<p>“Can we do it?” asked Harry, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do it,” replied Charley.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we unship our rudders and back
water till we get to the reeds?”</p>

<p>“It might be possible, but the chances are that we
would be swamped. The seas would overtake us,
and we couldn’t keep out of the way of them. No,
we’ve got to turn around and sail back in the regular
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“You know best, of course,” said Harry; “but
what’s the use of taking in our sails before we turn
around? We’ll have trouble in setting them again
with the wind astern.”</p>

<p>“We can turn the canoes quicker without sails
than we could with the sails set, and every second
that we can gain is worth something. Besides, if we
are capsized it will be an advantage to have the sails
furled. But we’re wasting time. Let your canoe get
right astern of mine, so that mine will keep a little
of the sea off of you; then watch for two or three big
seas and turn your canoe when they have passed.”</p>

<p>Harry followed his friend’s instructions, and succeeded
in turning his canoe without accident. Then
Charley, getting into the lee of the <i>Sunshine</i>, did his
best to imitate Harry’s successful feat. He managed
to turn the canoe, but while in the act a heavy sea
rolled into the cockpit and filled the <i>Midnight</i> absolutely
full. The beef-bladders, however, kept the
canoe afloat, but she lay like a log on the water, and
every successive wave swept over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Charley did not lose his presence of mind. He
shouted to Harry to run up his sail and keep his canoe
out of the way of the seas, and then he busied
himself shaking out the reef of his main-sail, so that
he could set the whole sail. The moment the canoe
felt the strain of her canvas she began to rush through
the water in spite of her great weight, and no more
seas came aboard her. Steering with one hand, Charley
bailed with his hat with such energy that he soon
freed the canoe of water. Meanwhile he rapidly
overtook Harry, and reached the reeds, while the
<i>Sunshine</i> was a quarter of a mile behind him.</p>

<p>Tom and Joe were found sitting in their canoes
and suffering the pangs of hunger. Charley put on
dry clothes, while Harry prepared a lunch of dried
beef and crackers, after which the canoeists resigned
themselves as cheerfully as they could to spending
the rest of the afternoon and the night in the reeds.
It was not a pleasant place, but the wind kept the
mosquitoes away, and the boys managed to fall asleep
soon after sunset. The wind died out during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
night, and the boys found, the next morning, that
only a few rods below the place where they had
spent the night there was an open channel by which
they could easily have reached the shore. This was
rather aggravating, and it increased the disgust with
which they remembered Lake St. Peter and its reed-lined
shores.</p>

<p>The voyage down the St. Lawrence seemed monotonous
after the excitement of running the Magog
rapids, and the various adventures of the sail down
the Richelieu. The St. Lawrence has very little
shade along its banks, for, owing to the direction in
which it runs, the sun shines on the water all day
long. The weather was exceedingly hot while the
boys were on the river, and on the third day after
leaving Lake St. Peter they suffered so greatly that
they were afraid to stay on the water lest they should
be sunstruck. Going ashore on the low sandy bank,
they were unable to find a single tree or even a hillock
large enough to afford any shade. They thought
of drawing the canoes ashore and sitting in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
shade of them, but there was not a breath of air stirring,
and the very ground was so hot that it almost
scorched their feet. Half a mile away on a meadow
they saw a tree, but it was far too hot to think of
walking that distance. They decided at last to get
into their canoes and to paddle a few rods farther to
a place where a small stream joined the river, and
where they hoped to find the water somewhat cooler
for bathing.</p>

<p>On reaching the mouth of the little stream the
bows of the canoes were run ashore, so that they
would not float away, and the boys, hastily undressing,
sprung into the water. They had a delightful
bath, and it was not until they began to feel chilly
that they thought of coming out and dressing. Tom
was the first to go ashore, and as he was wading out
of the water he suddenly felt himself sinking in the
sand. Harry and Joe attempted to land a few yards
from the place where Tom was trying to drag his
feet out of the clinging sand, and they too found
themselves in the same difficulty. Harry at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
perceived what was the matter, and, making frantic
efforts to get to the shore, cried out to his comrades
that they were caught in a quicksand.</p>

<p>The struggles made by the three boys were all in
vain. When they tried to lift one foot out of the
sand the other foot would sink still deeper. It was
impossible for them to throw themselves at full
length on the quicksand, for there were nearly two
feet of water over it, and they were not close enough
together to give one another any assistance. By the
time Charley fully understood the peril they were in,
Tom had sunk above his knees in the sand, and Joe
and Harry, finding that they could not extricate
themselves, were waiting, with white faces and trembling
lips, for Charley to come to their help.</p>

<p>Charley knew perfectly well that if he ventured
too near the other boys he would himself be caught
in the quicksand, and there would be no hope that
any of them could escape. Keeping his presence of
mind, he swum to the stern of one of the canoes, set
it afloat, and pushed it toward Tom so that the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
could get hold of its bow. He then brought two
other canoes to the help of Joe and Harry, and when
each of the three unfortunate canoeists was thus furnished
with something to cling to he climbed into
his own canoe.</p>

<p>“What are we to do now?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Just hold on to your canoes till I can tow them
out into the stream. You can’t sink while you hang
on to them.”</p>

<p>“Won’t the canoes sink with us?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. You wouldn’t sink yourselves
if you could lie down flat on the quicksand. I was
caught in a quicksand once, and that’s the way I
saved myself.”</p>

<p>“I hope it’s all right,” exclaimed Joe; “but it
seems to me that you’ll have to get a derrick to hoist
me out. But I’m not complaining. I can hang on
to my canoe all day, only I don’t want to be drowned
and buried both at the same time.”</p>

<p>Charley, meanwhile, was busily making his canoe
fast to Tom’s canoe with his painter. When this was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
done he paddled away from the shore with all his
might, while Tom tried to lift himself out of the
quicksand by throwing the weight of his body on
the canoe. Slowly Tom and his canoe yielded to the
vigorous strokes of Charley’s paddle and were towed
out into deep water. By the same means Joe and
Harry were rescued, and then the entire fleet&mdash;Charley
paddling, and the others swimming and pushing
their canoes&mdash;floated a short distance down stream,
and finally landed where the sand was firm and hard.</p>

<p>“What should we have done if you’d got into the
quicksand, as we did?” said Harry to Charley, as
they were dressing.</p>

<p>“By this time we should all have disappeared,”
replied Charley.</p>

<p>“I shall never go ashore again while we’re on this
river without making sure that I’m not walking into
a quicksand,” continued Harry. “It was awful to
find myself sinking deeper and deeper, and to know
that I couldn’t help myself.”</p>

<p>“Very likely there isn’t another quicksand the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
whole length of the St. Lawrence,” said Charley.
“However, it’s well enough to be careful where we
land. I’ve noticed that where a little stream joins a
big one the bottom is likely to be soft; but after all
a regular dangerous quicksand isn’t often met. I
never saw but one before.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” suggested Joe.</p>

<p>“No; we’ve talked enough about quicksands, and
the subject isn’t a cheerful one. Do you see that
pile of boards? Let’s make a board shanty, and go
to sleep in it after we’ve had some lunch. It will be
too hot to paddle before the end of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>A shanty was easily made by leaning a dozen
planks against the top of the pile of boards, and
after a comfortable lunch the boys took a long nap.
When they awoke they were disgusted to find that
their canoes were high and dry two rods from the
edge of the water. They had reached a part of the
river where the tide was felt, and without knowing
it they had gone ashore at high tide. They had to
carry the canoes, with all their contents, down to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
water, and as the receding tide had left a muddy
and slippery surface to walk over the task was not
a pleasant one. They congratulated themselves that
they had not gone ashore at low tide, in which case
the rising of the water during the night would have
carried away the canoes.</p>

<p>Sailing down the river with a gentle breeze, and
with the help of the ebbing tide, the canoeists came
to the mouth of a small river which entered the St.
Lawrence from the north. They knew by means of
the map that the small river was the Jacques Cartier.
It was a swift, shallow, and noisy stream, flowing
between high, precipitous banks, and spanned by a
lofty and picturesque bridge. Taking in their sails,
the boys entered the Jacques Cartier, picking their
way carefully among the rocks, and making headway
very slowly against the rapid current. They stopped
under the bridge, just above which there was an impassable
rapid, and went ashore for lunch.</p>

<p>Near by there was a saw-mill, and from one of the
workmen who came to look at the canoes the boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
heard wonderful reports of the fish to be caught in
the stream. It was full of salmon&mdash;so the man said&mdash;and
about nine miles from its mouth there was a
pool where the trout actually clamored to be caught.
The enthusiasm of the canoeists was kindled; and
they resolved to make a camp on the bank of the
stream, and to spend a few days in fishing.</p>

<p>After having thus excited his young hearers the
workman cruelly told them that the right to fish for
salmon was owned by a man living in Montreal, and
that any one catching a salmon without permission
would be heavily fined. The trout, however, belonged
to nobody, and the boys, though greatly disappointed
about the salmon, would not give up their
plan of trout-fishing. They hired two carts from a
farmer living a short distance from the river, and,
placing their canoes on the carts, walked beside them
over a wretchedly rough road until they reached a
place deep in the woods, where a little stream, icy
cold, joined the Jacques Cartier. Just before entering
the latter the little stream formed a quiet pool, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
which the trout could be seen jumping. The point
of land between the trout-stream and the river was
covered with a carpet of soft grass, and on this the
canoes were placed and made ready to be slept in.</p>

<p>The workman at the mouth of the Jacques Cartier
had not exaggerated the number of trout in the pool.
It was alive with fish. The boys were charmed with
the beauty of their camping-ground and the luxury
of their table. It was rather tiresome to walk two
miles every day to the nearest farm-house for milk,
but with the milk rice griddle cakes were made,
and upon these and fresh-killed trout the canoeists
feasted for three delightful days.</p>

<p class="center">“THEY FOUND A BEAR FEASTING UPON THE REMAINS OF THEIR BREAKFAST.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>They had one real adventure while on the Jacques
Cartier. One day, when they returned to their camp
from an exploration of the upper part of the trout-stream,
they found a bear feasting upon the remains
of their breakfast and their bottle of maple-sirup,
which he had upset and broken. The animal was
full-grown, and looked like a very ugly customer, but
no sooner did he see the boys than he started on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
a rapid run for the woods. By the time the boys
had found their pistols and were ready to follow him
the bear had disappeared, and though they hunted for
him all the rest of the day they could not find him.
Had the bear taken it into his head to hunt the boys
he would probably have been much more successful,
for their pistol-bullets would have had little effect
upon him, except to sharpen his appetite for tender
and wholesome boys’-meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_XI"><span class="smcap">Chapter XI.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">IT sometimes blows very hard on the St. Lawrence.
It blew especially hard the morning the young
canoeists returned to the banks of the great river
from their excursion up the Jacques Cartier. As far
as they could see the St. Lawrence was covered with
white-caps. The wind blew directly up the river,
and a heavy sea was breaking on the little island
which lay opposite the mouth of the Jacques Cartier.
Paddling against such a wind and sea would have
been nearly impossible, and the boys resolved to
wait until the wind should go down.</p>

<p>The day was a long one, for there was nothing to
do but to watch the men at work in the saw-mill,
and to look out on the river to see if the wind and
sea had gone down. It continued to blow hard all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
day and all night, and when Harry awoke his comrades
at five o’clock the next morning it was blowing
as hard as ever.</p>

<p>Nobody wanted to spend another day at the saw-mill.
Although the wind was blowing up the river
the tide was ebbing, and would help the canoes to
make some little progress, in spite of the wind and
sea. So after a hurried breakfast the fleet got under
way at six o’clock and gallantly breasted the waves.</p>

<p>The boys found that paddling against so strong a
head-wind was harder than they had imagined that
it could be. It was almost impossible to force the
upper blade of the paddle through the air when trying
to make a stroke, and it was only by turning the
two paddle-blades at right angles to one another,
so that the upper blade would present its edge to
the wind, that this could be done. The seas were
so large that the two canoes which were leading
would often be entirely invisible to the other canoes,
though they were but a few yards apart. The <i>Twilight</i>,
as was her habit when driven against head-seas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
threw spray all over herself, and the <i>Dawn</i> exhibited
her old vice of trying to dive through the
seas. The other canoes were dry enough, but they
presented more resistance to the wind, and hence
were harder to paddle.</p>

<p>Little was said during the first half-hour, for
everybody was working too hard at the paddle to
have any breath to spare for talking; but finally
Harry, who was in the advance with Charley, slackened
his stroke, and, hailing Joe and Tom, asked
them how they were getting along.</p>

<p>“Wet as usual,” replied Joe. “The water is pretty
near up to my waist in the canoe, and two waves
out of three wash right over her. But I don’t care;
I’ll paddle as long as anybody else will.”</p>

<p>“My canoe will float, unless the bladders burst,”
said Tom, “but I’ll have to stop and bail out before
long, or she’ll be so heavy that I can’t stir her.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” cried Joe. “Look at the splendid
time we’re making. We’ve come nearly a quarter of
a mile, and that means that we’re paddling at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
rate of half a mile an hour. At this rate we’ll get
somewhere in the course of the summer.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any use in tiring ourselves out for
nothing,” exclaimed Harry. “Boys! we’ll make that
sand-spit right ahead of us, and wait there till the
wind goes down.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joe. “Only it’s a pity to go
ashore when the tide is helping us along so beautifully.
That is, the Commodore said it would help
us, and of course he is right.”</p>

<p>“No reflections on the Commodore will be allowed,”
cried Harry. “Bail out your canoes, you two
fellows, and Charley and I will wait for you.”</p>

<p>Joe was very anxious to go ashore and rest, for
he was nearly tired out; but he was not willing to
let Harry know that he was tired. The two boys
had been disputing while on the Jacques Cartier as
to their respective strength, and Harry had boasted
that he could endure twice as much fatigue as Joe.
This was true enough, for Harry was older and much
more muscular, but Joe was determined to paddle as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
long as he could swing his arms rather than to admit
that he was the weaker.</p>

<p>The sandy spit where Harry proposed to rest was
half a mile farther on, but before it was reached poor
Joe managed to sprain the muscles of his left wrist.
He was compelled to stop paddling except just hard
enough to keep the <i>Dawn’s</i> head to the sea, and to
call out to the Commodore that he must be allowed
to go ashore at once.</p>

<p>Now, the north shore of the river, near which the
canoes were paddling, was a rocky precipice, rising
perpendicularly directly from the water, and at least
two hundred feet high. To land on such a shore
was, of course, impossible, and the sandy spit toward
which the fleet was paddling was the only possible
landing-place within sight, unless the canoes were to
turn round and run back to the Jacques Cartier.</p>

<p>In this state of things Harry, after consulting with
Charley and Tom, resolved to tow the <i>Dawn</i>. Her
painter was made fast to the stern-post of the <i>Sunshine</i>,
and Harry, bracing his feet and setting his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
teeth tight together, began the task of forcing two
heavy canoes through the rough water. He found
that he could make progress slowly, but Joe could
not steer the <i>Dawn</i> except by paddling, and as he
was able to do very little of that she kept yawing
about in a most unpleasant way, which greatly added
to Harry’s labor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Joe had a happy thought: he set his
“dandy” and hauled the sheet taut, so that the
boom was parallel with the keel. The effect of this
was that whenever the canoe’s head fell off the sail
filled and brought her up again. Joe was relieved
of the task of steering, and Harry was able to tow
the <i>Dawn</i> much more easily than before.</p>

<p>The other canoeists followed Joe’s example, and,
setting their “dandies,” greatly lessened their labor.
The canoes kept their heads to the wind of their
own accord, and everybody wondered why so obvious
a method of fighting a head-wind had not sooner
been thought of.</p>

<p>It was eight o’clock when the sandy spit was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
reached. The tide had been ebbing for some hours,
and the sand was warm and dry, except near the
edge of the water. The canoes were hauled some
distance over the sand to a spot where there was a
clump of bushes, and where it was reasonable to suppose
that they would be perfectly safe even at high
tide. A second breakfast was then cooked and eaten,
after which the boys set out to explore their camping-ground.</p>

<p>It was simply a low sand-bank, about a hundred
feet wide at widest part, and running out two or
three hundred feet into the river. As has been said,
the north bank of the river was a perpendicular
precipice, but now that the tide was out there was a
path at the foot of the precipice by means of which
any one could walk from the sand-spit to a ravine a
quarter of a mile away, and thus reach the meadows
lying back of the precipice. This path was covered
with water at high tide; but, as it was sure to be
passable for three or four hours, Harry and Tom set
out to procure provisions for the day.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>The fleet was wind-bound all that day, for neither
the wind nor the sea showed the slightest intention
of going down. Harry and Tom returned after an
hour’s absence, with bread, butter, eggs, milk, and
strawberries, and with the cheerful information that,
in the opinion of a gloomy farmer, the wind would
continue to blow for at least two days more.</p>

<p>After resting and sleeping on the soft sand the
boys began to find the time hang heavily on their
hands. They overhauled their sails and rigging, putting
them in complete order. Charley mended a pair
of trousers belonging to Joe in a really artistic way;
and Joe, with his left arm in a sling, played “mumble-te-peg”
with Harry. Tom collected fire-wood,
and, when he had got together more than enough to
cook two or three meals, occupied himself by trying
to roll a heavy log into a position near the canoes,
where it could be used as a seat or a table.</p>

<p>The sand was strewn with logs, big and little, and
Harry proposed that as many logs as possible should
be got together, so that an enormous camp-fire could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
be started. It was a happy idea, for it gave the boys
employment for the greater part of the day. It became
a matter of pride with them to bring the biggest
and heaviest of the logs up to the fireplace.
Some of them could only be stirred with levers, and
moved with the help of rollers cut from smaller logs.
Whenever a particularly big log was successfully
moved the boys were encouraged to attack a still
bigger one. Thus they finally collected an amount
of fire-wood sufficient to make a blaze bright enough
to be seen a dozen miles at night.</p>

<p>When they were tired of rolling logs Tom went
fishing, but caught nothing; while Charley cooked
the dinner and watched the rising tide&mdash;half afraid
that the water would reach the fire and put it out
before he could get dinner ready. The tide rose so
high that it came within two or three yards of the
fire, and almost as near to the canoes, but it spared
the dinner. When the tide was nearly full only a
small part of the sand-spit was out of water, and the
path along the foot of the precipice was completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
covered, so that the waves broke directly against the
rocks.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky for us that the tide doesn’t cover the
whole of this place,” remarked Charley as he placed
the dinner on a large log which served as a table,
and beat a tattoo on the frying-pan as a signal to
Tom to give up fishing and come to dinner. “I
should hate to have to take to the canoes again in
this wind.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky that the tide will ebb again,” said
Harry, “for we’re cut off from the shore as the tide
is now, unless we could climb up the rocks, and I
don’t believe we could.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Tom, putting his fishing-tackle
in his canoe, “provided the tide doesn’t come up in
the night and float the canoes off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that can’t happen!” exclaimed Harry. “The
tide’s turned already, and doesn’t reach the canoes.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to sleep on the sand,” remarked Joe.
“It’s softer than the bottom of my canoe, and there
isn’t any sign of rain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t catch me sleeping anywhere except in
my canoe,” said Harry. “There isn’t any bed more
comfortable than the <i>Sunshine</i>.”</p>

<p>“Can you turn over in her at night?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Well, yes; that is, if I do it very slow and
easy.”</p>

<p>“The bottom-board is a nice soft piece of wood,
isn’t it?” continued Joe.</p>

<p>“It’s pine-wood,” replied Harry, shortly. “Besides,
I sleep on cushions.”</p>

<p>“And you like to lie stretched out perfectly
straight, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I like it well enough&mdash;much better than I like to
see a young officer trying to chaff his Commodore,”
returned Harry, trying to look very stern.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not trying to chaff anybody!” exclaimed
Joe. “I was only wondering if your canoe was as
comfortable as a coffin would be, and I believe it is&mdash;every
bit as comfortable.”</p>

<p>When the time came for “turning in” Joe spread
his water-proof blanket on the sand close by the side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of his canoe. He had dragged her several yards
away from the rest of the fleet, so as to be able
to make his bed on the highest and driest part of
the sand, and to shelter himself from the wind by
lying in the lee of his boat. The other boys preferred
to sleep in their canoes, which were placed
side by side and close together. The blazing logs
made the camp almost as light as if the sun were
shining, and the boys lay awake a long while talking
together, and hoping that the wind would die
out before morning.</p>

<p>Joe, whose sprained wrist pained him a little, was
the last to fall asleep. While he had expressed no
fears about the tide (for he did not wish to be thought
nervous), he was a little uneasy about it. He had noticed
that when the tide rose during the day it would
have completely covered the sand-spit had it risen
only a few inches higher. Long after his comrades
had fallen asleep it occurred to Joe that it would
have been a wise precaution to make the canoes fast
to the bushes, so that they could not be carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
away; but he did not venture to wake the boys
merely in order to give them advice which they
probably would not accept. So he kept silent, and
toward ten o’clock fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the course of the night he began to dream. He
thought that he was a member of an expedition trying
to reach the North Pole in canoes, and that he
was sleeping on the ice. He felt that his feet and
back were slowly freezing, and that a polar-bear was
nudging him in the ribs occasionally, to see if he
was alive and ready to be eaten. This was such
an uncomfortable situation that Joe woke up, and
for a few moments could not understand where he
was.</p>

<p>The wind had gone down, the stars had come out,
and the tide had come up. Joe was lying in a shallow
pool of water, and his canoe, which was almost
afloat, was gently rubbing against him. He sprung
up and called to his companions. There was no answer.
The fire was out, but by the starlight Joe
could see that the whole sand-spit was covered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
water, and that neither the other boys nor their canoes
were in sight. The tide was still rising, and
Joe’s canoe was beginning to float away, when he
seized her, threw his blankets into her, and, stepping
aboard, sat down, and was gently floated away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_XII"><span class="smcap">Chapter XII.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">JOE was alone on the St. Lawrence in the middle
of the night, and with a sprained wrist, which
nearly disabled him so far as paddling was concerned.
Worse than this, his comrades had disappeared,
and there could not be the slightest doubt
that their canoes had floated away with them while
they were sound asleep. What chance had he of
finding them? How could he get ashore, with his
sprained wrist; and what probability was there that
the three boys thus carried away in their sleep
would escape from their dangerous situation without
any serious accident?</p>

<p>As these questions presented themselves to Joe
his first impulse was to admit that he was completely
disheartened and to burst into tears. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
was, however, far too manly to yield to it, and he immediately
began to think what was the best thing
that he could do in the circumstances.</p>

<p>The water was perfectly smooth, so that there was
really no danger that the runaway canoes would capsize,
unless their owners should start up in a fright
and not fully understand that their canoes were no
longer on solid land. Neither was there much chance
that they would be run down by steamboats, for the
steamboat channel was near the south shore of the
river, a long distance from the sand-spit. Joe remembered
how fast the tide had risen the day before, and
he calculated that the missing canoes must have
been afloat about half an hour before the water
reached the place where he was sleeping. They
would naturally drift in the same direction in which
the <i>Dawn</i> was drifting; and all that it would be
necessary for Joe to do in order to overtake them
would be to increase the speed at which his canoe
was moving.</p>

<p>There was a scarcely perceptible breeze blowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
from the south. Joe got up his main-mast and set his
sail. Light as the breeze was, the canoe felt it, and
began to move through the water. Joe steered by
the stars, and kept the <i>Dawn</i> as nearly as possible
on the course which he supposed the other canoes
had taken. He had no lantern with him, and could
see but a little distance ahead in the dark, but he
shouted every few moments, partly in order to attract
the attention of the missing canoeists, and partly
in order to warn any other boat that might be in
the neighborhood not to run him down.</p>

<p>After sailing in this way for at least an hour, and
hearing no sound whatever but his own voice and
the creaking of the canoe’s spars, Joe was startled at
perceiving a black object just ahead of him. He
avoided it with a vigorous movement of his paddle,
and as he drifted close to it with the wind shaken
out of his sail he saw to his great delight that it was
a canoe.</p>

<p>It was the <i>Sunshine</i>, with her canoe-tent rigged
over her, and her commander sound asleep. Taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
hold of her gunwale, Joe drew the two canoes together
and put his hand gently on Harry’s forehead.
Harry instantly awoke, and hearing Joe begging him
as he valued his life to lie perfectly still, took the
latter’s advice, and asked, with some alarm, what
was the matter. When he learned that he was adrift
on the river he sat up, took down his tent, and getting
out his paddle joined in the search for Tom and
Charley.</p>

<p>“They must be close by,” said Harry, “for all
three canoes must have floated away at the same
time. Tom and Charley sleep sounder than I do,
and if I didn’t wake up it’s pretty certain that they
didn’t.”</p>

<p>Presently Charley’s canoe was overtaken. Charley
had been awakened by the sound of Harry’s paddle
and the loud tone in which Harry and Joe were talking.
He was sitting up when the <i>Dawn</i> and the
<i>Sunshine</i> overtook him; and having comprehended
the situation in which he found himself on awaking,
he was making ready to paddle ashore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>There was now only one canoe missing&mdash;the <i>Twilight</i>.
Harry, Joe, and Charley took turns in shouting
at the top of their lungs for Tom, but they could
obtain no answer except the echo from the cliffs of
the north shore. They paddled up the river until
they were certain that they had gone farther than
Tom could possibly have drifted, and then turned
and paddled down stream, shouting at intervals, and
growing more and more alarmed at finding no trace
of the lost canoe.</p>

<p>“She can’t have sunk, that’s one comfort,” exclaimed
Harry, “for the bladders that Tom put in
her at Chambly would keep her afloat, even if he
did manage to capsize her in the dark.”</p>

<p>“He took the bladders out yesterday morning and
left them on the sand just in the lee of his canoe,”
said Charley. “Don’t you remember that he sponged
her out after we landed, and that he said that he
wouldn’t put his things back into her until we were
ready to start?”</p>

<p>“I remember it now,” replied Harry. “And I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
remember that I did the same thing. There’s nothing
in my canoe now except my water-proof bag and
my blankets. But they’re not of much consequence
compared with Tom. Boys, do you really think he’s
drowned?”</p>

<p>“Of course he isn’t,” cried Joe. “We’ll find him
in a few minutes. He must be somewhere near by,
and he’s sleeping so sound that he don’t hear us.
You know how hard it is to wake him up.”</p>

<p>“Tom is a first-rate swimmer, and if he has spilt
himself out of his canoe and she has sunk, he has
swum ashore,” said Charley. “My opinion is that
we had better stay just where we are until daylight,
and then look for him along the shore. He’s worth
a dozen drowned fellows, wherever he is.”</p>

<p>Charley’s advice was taken, and the boys waited
for daylight as patiently as they could. Daylight&mdash;or
rather dawn&mdash;came in the course of an hour, but
not a glimpse of the missing canoe did it afford. The
tide had already changed, and the top of the treacherous
sand-spit was once more above water, and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
very far distant from the canoes. As soon as it was
certain that nothing could be seen of Tom on the
water his alarmed comrades paddled toward the
north shore, hoping that they might find him, and
possibly his canoe, somewhere at the foot of the
rocks.</p>

<p>They were again unsuccessful. While Joe sailed
up and down along the shore, the two other boys
paddled close to the rocks, and searched every foot of
space where it would have been possible for a canoe
to land, or a canoeist to keep a footing above the
water. They had searched the shore for a full mile
above the sand-spit and had paddled back nearly
half the way, when they were suddenly hailed, and
looking up, saw Tom standing on a ledge of rock ten
feet above the water.</p>

<p>“Are you fellows going to leave me here all day?”
demanded Tom. “I began to think you were all
drowned, and that I’d have to starve to death up
here.”</p>

<p class="center">“HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET UP THERE?”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“How in the world did you get up there?”
“Where were you when we came by here half an
hour ago?” “Where’s your canoe?” “Are you all
right?” These and a dozen other questions were
hurled at Tom by his excited and overjoyed friends.</p>

<p>“I was asleep until a few minutes ago,” replied
Tom. “I got up here when the tide was high, and
I had hard work to do it, too.”</p>

<p>“What’s become of your canoe? Is she lost?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>“She’s somewhere at the bottom of the river. I
tried to turn over in her in the night, thinking she
was on the sand-spit, but she turned over with me,
and sunk before I could make out what had happened.”</p>

<p>“And then you swum ashore?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I saw the north-star, and knew that if
I could swim long enough I could find the shore.
When I struck these rocks I was disappointed, for I
couldn’t find a place where I could land until I got
my hands on this ledge and drew myself up.”</p>

<p>“Unless Tom wants to stay where he is we’d better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
invent some way of taking him with us,” remarked
Joe.</p>

<p>“He’ll have to get into my canoe,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“How deep is the water where you are?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s anywhere from six feet to sixty. I can’t
touch bottom with the paddle, so it’s certain to be
more than seven feet deep.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you’ll please to give me room, I’ll jump,
and somebody can pick me up.”</p>

<p>Tom jumped into the water, and had little trouble
in climbing into Harry’s canoe&mdash;the water being perfectly
quiet. The fleet then paddled back to the
sand-spit, where they landed and breakfasted, while
Tom dried his clothes by the fire.</p>

<p>Every member of the expedition except Joe had
lost something, and poor Tom had lost his canoe and
everything except the clothes which he was wearing.
As long as the water continued to be smooth Tom
could be carried in either Harry’s or Charley’s canoe,
but in case the wind and sea should rise it would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
very difficult, if not impossible, to keep the canoe
right side up with two persons in her. Quebec was
still at least twenty-five miles distant, and it would
take nearly a whole day of very hard work to paddle
a heavy canoe, with two boys in her, only one
of whom was furnished with a paddle, twenty-five
miles, even in the most favorable circumstances.
Moreover, Joe’s sprained wrist made it impossible
for him to paddle, and the wind was so light that
sailing to Quebec was out of the question.</p>

<p>It was therefore decided that Harry should take
Joe in the <i>Sunshine</i> back to the Jacques Cartier, and
leaving him to walk to the nearest railway-station,
should return to the sand-spit and join Tom and
Charley in paddling down to Quebec, Tom taking
Joe’s canoe. Although the boys had originally intended
to end their cruise at Quebec, they had become
so fond of canoeing that they would gladly
have gone on to the Saguenay River and, if possible,
to Lake St. John; but now that Tom was without
a canoe no one thought of prolonging the cruise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>Quebec was reached by the fleet several hours
after Joe had arrived there by the train. He was
at the landing-place to meet his comrades, and had
already made a bargain with a canal-boatman to
carry the canoes all the way to New York for five
dollars each. As the <i>Sunshine</i> was fitted with
hatches which fastened with a lock, and as it would
be necessary for the Custom-house officer at Rouse’s
Point to search her, Harry wrote to the Custom-house
at that place, giving directions how to open
the lock. It was a padlock without a key, one of
the so-called letter-locks which can be opened by
placing the letters in such a position that they spell
some particular word. Harry had provided the
canoe with this lock expressly in order to avoid
trouble at Custom-houses, and in this instance the
plan proved completely successful, for the officer at
Rouse’s Point was able to unlock the canoe and to
lock it up again without a key.</p>

<p>The boys spent a night and a day at Quebec,
and, after seeing their canoes safely started, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
took the train for New York. As they talked over
their cruise on the way home they agreed that canoeing
was far more delightful than any other way of
cruising, and that they would go on a canoe cruise
every summer.</p>

<p>“As soon as I can afford it I shall get a new canoe,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Will you get a ‘Rice Laker?’” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Of course I will. My canoe was much the best
boat in the fleet, and I shall get another exactly like
her.”</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt that you are a genuine canoeist,
Tom,” said Charley. “You’ve had lots of trouble
with your canoe because she had no deck, and at last
she sunk and nearly drowned you, because she had
no water-tight compartments; but for all that you
really think that she was the best canoe ever built.
Is everybody else convinced that his own canoe is
the best in the world?”</p>

<p>“I am,” cried Joe.</p>

<p>“And I am,” cried Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“So am I,” added Charley; “and as this proves
that we are all thorough canoeists, we will join the
American Canoe Association at once, and cruise under
its flag next summer.”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
